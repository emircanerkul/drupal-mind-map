  Run the update script, and 'Clear all caches' When a site is acting strangely,
  or displays bizarre errors, or displays a blank page, particularly just after
  enabling a new module, the first thing to do is refresh the page. After that,
  it is often found that 'running the update script', followed by 'clearing all
  caches', solves majority of the problems. Of the two, 'Clear all caches' is an
  easier, and quicker 'fix' to try, and is at times effective but, the steps
  below will start with 'running the update script', because that is the first
  thing to do whenever any website is giving trouble.

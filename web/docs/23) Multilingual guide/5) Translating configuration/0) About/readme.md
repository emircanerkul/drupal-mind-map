The Configuration Translation module (part of Drupal Core in Drupal 8) allows configuration to be translated into different languages. Views, your site name, contact module categories, vocabularies, menus, blocks, and so on are all stored within the unified configuration system and can be translated with this module. Content, such as nodes, taxonomy terms, custom blocks, and so on are translatable with the Content Translation module in Drupal core, while the built-in user interface (such as registration forms, content submission and administration interfaces) are translated with the Interface Translation module. Use these three modules effectively together to translate your whole site to different languages.

Configuration translation relies on having a [correct configuration schema](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/api/configuration-api/configuration-schemametadata) to provide translations. So, every module must provide a correct schema.

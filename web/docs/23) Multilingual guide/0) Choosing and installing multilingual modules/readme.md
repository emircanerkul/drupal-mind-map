  Drupal 8's Multilingual improvements When you install Drupal 8, the first
  thing you need to choose is the base language for the installation. The
  installer will attempt to make the reasonable choice based on your browser
  language, and should display the page in your browser language. If you are
  making a multilingual site, choose one of the languages that you want to use
  as installation language, and preferably not English (a non-English choice
  will cause some modules you'll need to be installed).

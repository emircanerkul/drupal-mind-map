We have prepared a [multilingual Drupal 8 demonstration distribution](https://www.drupal.org/project/multilingual%5Fdemo) with sample data (and raw Google Translated sample text, be warned) to try.

You can download this distro or more simple, [try it on simplytest.me](http://simplytest.me/project/multilingual%5Fdemo/8.x-1.x)

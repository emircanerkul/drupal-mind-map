Drupalâ€™s newest default theme, Olivero, was developed with accessibility as a first class citizen. Special care has been taken to ensure the multi-level menu system is extremely accessible. Focus states throughout the theme are clear and obvious. Forced colors modes such as Windows high contrast mode work flawlessly. Extensive testing has been performed including testing by the National Federation for the Blind.

  Hiding content is very useful for accessibility. We can hide things visually
  and only display it to screen reader users, we can hide content from screen
  reader users and only show it visually, or we can hide content from both.
  Drupal comes with some built-in CSS classes that can help make sure that the
  intentions are clear. We recommend against using { display:none; } as it is
  often misused.

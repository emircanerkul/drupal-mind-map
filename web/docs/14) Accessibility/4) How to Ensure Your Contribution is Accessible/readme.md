  You know you want your module/initiative/theme/patch/core contribution to be
  accessible, but aren’t sure how to make this happen. The BBC’s Accessibility
  Champions approach has been very successful, and the Drupal community can use
  it as a base to model our own recommended process. Accessibility isn’t easy
  and often requires creativity, testing, and and open mind. It is most
  efficiently and elegantly achieved when it is part of the process all the way
  through, starting right from the beginning.

Are you part of any contributions to Drupal core, themes, modules, or patches? If so, then yes, this is relevant. Drupal is frequently used by universities, governments, and large institutions around the world, many of which are legally bound to provide accessible digital experiences.

Remediating inaccessible features and refactoring inaccessible code can be extremely time consuming and/or expensive. It can mean rendering a beautiful theme ugly because changes have to be forced in rather than part of the design process from the beginning.

Creating something accessible from the ground up is far more elegant, significantly easier, and less costly.

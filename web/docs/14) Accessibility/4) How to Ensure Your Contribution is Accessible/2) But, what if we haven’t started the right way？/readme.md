* **What if our work is already underway and we didn’t start with this approach?**  
 Start as soon as you can. The community is here to support you.
* **What if we don’t know enough?**  
 There are resources to help you along the way, and the Accessibility Topic Maintainers are here to help, not judge. We will be able to direct you towards resources, as well.
* **What if we cannot find an accessibility champion?**  
 If you have to be your own accessibility champion, you’ll find the role rewarding and learn a lot. But there are a lot of community members active on the #accessibility slack channel, which is a great place to start.
* **What if we got it wrong?**  
 Then someone will raise the concern in the issue queue, and you’ll work with them to figure out how to fix it and make your work even better. That’s a good thing.

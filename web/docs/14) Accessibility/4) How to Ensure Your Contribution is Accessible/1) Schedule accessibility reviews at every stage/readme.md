Anything that goes into Drupal core must pass the accessibility gate, which means an Accessibility Topic Maintainer has to sign off on it. Getting this sign off at the end of the project, however, as you near completion, might be very difficult if you havenâ€™t made accessibility part of the process right from initial ideation.

Your best path toward accessibility is to schedule regular reviews with the Accessibility Topic Maintainers. At minimum, we recommend the following:

1. **Design review**  
   1. Interaction design (including visual)  
   2. Engineering design: how you choose to implement your solutions and code can have a significant impact on accessibility, and it is worth reviewing your plan with an Accessibility Topic Maintainer for gotchas before starting the actual work
2. **Alpha review**  
 An Accessibility Topic Maintainer has seen your prototype and roadmap; the scope is clear, and accessibility challenges have been identified (but may not yet have solutions)
3. **Beta review**  
 All accessibility issues have been identified, and you know how they will be fixed (though they may not yet be fixed); an Accessibility Topic Maintainer has signed off on your planned approach
4. **Stable review**  
 All accessibility issues have been resolved and satisfactorily tested; the code has cleared the accessibility gate for being released into core

Our suggestion is that you aim for official sign-off from an Accessibility Topic Maintainer at each of these stages in order to smooth the stable sign-off (also known as the accessibility gate to getting something released in core).

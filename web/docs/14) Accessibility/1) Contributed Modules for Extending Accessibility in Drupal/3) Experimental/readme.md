### [Accessibility Scanner](https://www.drupal.org/project/accessibility%5Fscanner)

**Latest Versions:** 2.0.0-beta1 

The Accessibility Scanner module allows you to use Drupal in combination with Deque's [Axe toolset](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@axe-core/cli) to perform web accessibility scans on local and remote websites based on a list of URLs or XML sitemaps, all within the familiar Drupal admin interface.

### [Automatic Alternative Text](https://www.drupal.org/project/auto%5Falter)

**Latest Version:** 8.x-1.7

The module uses the [Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services API](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services) to generate an Alternative Text for images when no Alternative Text has been provided by user.

Note: AI and image recognition can be beneficial to prompt authors, but cannot replace author input. What a computer sees in an image is rarely going to be the same as what the author wants to feature with that image.

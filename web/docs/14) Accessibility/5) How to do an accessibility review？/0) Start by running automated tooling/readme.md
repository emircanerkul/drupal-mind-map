Many accessibility problems can be caught by running the page through automated tools. Some of the automated tools include [WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org), [Tenon](https://tenon.io/get-code/), [Accessibility Insights](https://accessibilityinsights.io), [Google Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/), [Siteimprove](https://siteimprove.com/) and the [Siteimprove Accessibility Checker](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/search/siteimprove?hl=en-US) extension for Chrome. Some of this can be automated by using [axe-core](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core/). These tools will help you quickly catch some accessibility issues, such as the incorrect structure of the markup, missing ARIA attributes and insufficient color contrast.

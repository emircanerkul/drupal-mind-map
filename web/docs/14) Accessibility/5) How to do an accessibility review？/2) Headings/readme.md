Headings are the framework of your content. A good heading structure reflects the content on your page, like the index of a book. Having descriptive headings and meaningful levels is important because some screen reader users use them for skimming the contents of the page.

If you have already run one of the automated accessibility tools, you’ve most likely covered most of the issues related to headings.

### What to look for

* Is there only one H1 element per page?  
   * There should be only one H1 element per page, that describes what the page is about.
* Do the heading levels match the content?  
   * It’s important to use the other headings based on their level and not by their font size. It’s important not to skip levels on headings.
* Are the headings descriptive enough?  
   * Good heading texts describe in short the content that follows the heading.

### There must be sufficient color contrast

Color contrast is the ratio of the foreground color (text) and the background color. Text should have a ratio of 4.5:1 or greater with the background. You can use a [color contrast checker](https://contrast-ratio.com) to determine whether your colors comply with this requirement.

### Color must not be the only means of displaying visual information

Although color is a valid means of displaying visual information, it canâ€™t be the _only_ way that information is conveyed. People with color blindness can experience difficulty when color alone is used to convey important information (and they may miss it entirely).

If using color to convey information, use at least one of the following extra methods too:

* Use meaningful text to provide the information. For example "on" and "off" next to a circle which changes from green to red.
* Use a meaningful icon, so users can distinguish meaning by shape.
* To indicate form errors, don't just say "the fields marked red". It's better to say the names of the fields, and mark them with a recognizable error icon.

Another example is marking required fields with red. Some users may not be able to distinguish red from other colors and would lack information to fill out this form. This can be addressed by adding an asterisk to the field label.

Focus states should not rely on color alone. An additional shape is necessary to convey focus. Typically this would be an extra outline surrounding the interactive control which has focus.

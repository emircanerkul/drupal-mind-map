Animations, videos and/or Audio that automatically plays without control of the user can be distracting to other parts of the page. Even if the animations or videos are in a position of the page that you might not think will cause an issue, we are agnostic to how users are viewing the page.

Examples of Animations, Autoplay video and audio:

* Animations: A carousel automatically loops through a range of images;
* Autoplay video: A YouTube video plays as soon as the page is loaded;
* Autoplay audio: A radio feed plays as soon as the page is loaded.

To reduce the amount of distractions on the page:

* Avoid playing animations, video and content for longer than 5 seconds.
* Provide controls for the user so that they can choose when to stop, play and pause the animation, video and audio.

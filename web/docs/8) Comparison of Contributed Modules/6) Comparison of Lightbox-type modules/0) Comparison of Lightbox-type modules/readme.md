  There are various modules in Drupal which provide "lightbox" type
  functionality. These modules usually use JavaScript to overlay images on the
  current page when clicked upon, which has the advantage of being able to show
  users the large version of a thumbnail image while keeping them on the same
  page. However, there are a number of these modules available, each quite
  similar but some have more features, while others are more lightweight or have
  better browser support. This article attempts to do a comparison between these
  modules to allow you to choose which one best suits your needs.

There are various modules in Drupal which provide "lightbox" type functionality. These modules usually use JavaScript to overlay images on the current page when clicked upon, which has the advantage of being able to show users the large version of a thumbnail image while keeping them on the same page. However, there are a number of these modules available, each quite similar but some have more features, while others are more lightweight or have better browser support.

This article attempts to do a comparison between these modules to allow you to choose which one best suits your needs. For the purposes of this comparison, the "lightbox" type functionality where content can be displayed in a container overlayed on the current page, whether it be for images, iframed content or videos, shall be referred to as a "lightbox".

As modules are constantly changing, this page is often not fully up to date, so use this page with some caution.

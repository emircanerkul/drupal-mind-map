  This document is intended to provide an overview of the different features of
  the available Group modules: Group Organic Groups Architecture Each Group is
  an entity, which can have multiple bundle "group types". Any other entity,
  such as a Node can be associated with a Group via a relationship entity,
  confusingly called a "group content" entity. Note that the group content
  entity doesn't contain the content itself, it is merely an entity that forms
  the relation between the group and the actual content. The "gnode" submodule
  provides the group content entity for Nodes.

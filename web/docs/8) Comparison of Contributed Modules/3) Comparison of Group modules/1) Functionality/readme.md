Both packages have similar functionality in the table below, the differences are from the architecture. This table notes differences based on final D7\. User means ordinary user, of course a dev ops user can extend either package.

| Content can belong to multiple groups          | content independent of group unless a gnode                                                              | content is the group                                        |

| Roles and permissions can be managed per group | built-in as described in Architecture above and/or extend with roles module(s) and group\_membership.inc | via og\_membership.inc and at module, node permission level |

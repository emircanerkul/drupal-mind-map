  Overview The project usage overview page reports week-by-week usage of Drupal
  core and contributed modules and themes. Usage figures are a count of sites
  using the item that week. The results shown give an idea of how popular the
  different projects are and may help you choose modules and themes for your own
  site. How does it work? As always with statistics of this sort, they don't
  tell the whole story. For example, the results shown for "Drupal" are a poor
  estimate of the number of Drupal sites on the internet.

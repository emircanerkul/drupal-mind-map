As always with statistics of this sort, they don't tell the whole story. For example, the [results shown for "Drupal"](/project/usage/drupal) are a poor estimate of the number of Drupal sites on the internet. This is because **only sites running the [Update Status](/handbook/modules/update) (Drupal 5-7) and [Update Manager](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/core/modules/update/overview) (Drupal 8-) modules report data back** to drupal.org.

Weekly data is based on the numbers for each Sunday. However, it takes a few days before the data is published.

### Historical data

Update Status has been included in the Drupal download since the 6.0 release (and the installer prompts the user to allow it to be enabled when the site is first installed). In Drupal 5.x it is only [available as a contributed module](/project/update%5Fstatus). This means firstly, the actual number of sites running Drupal is higher than the figures would suggest, and secondly, the results are heavily biased towards sites running Drupal 6.x and later.

Even so, the usage figures reported are a really useful indicator of what other people are using on their sites and may suggest some modules or themes that you should investigate.

At present, translations and theme engines are not monitored by Update Status and so their usage data is not recorded.

### The module generating the data here on drupal.org

The usage pages on drupal.org themselves are generated by the [Project module](/project/project). If you have suggestions or bug reports about the display of usage statistics, please search in the [Usage statistics](/project/issues/project?component=Usage+statistics) component of the [Project module issue queue](/project/issues/project) and if there is not an existing issue about your idea, please submit an issue there.

Note that issues with the actual data itself do likely depend on the [Drupal.org infrastructure](https://www.drupal.org/project/infrastructure "Project page on Drupal.org") and should be posted in [that issue queue](https://www.drupal.org/project/issues/infrastructure "Issues for Drupal.org infrastructure | Drupal.org") instead. Think of the reported numbers being significantly different for all projects or statistics not being updated.

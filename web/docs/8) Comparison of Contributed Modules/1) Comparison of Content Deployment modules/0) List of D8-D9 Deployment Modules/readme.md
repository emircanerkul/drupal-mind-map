#### Overview of List of D8/D9 Deployment Modules

When speaking of _content deployment_, this list of modules takes the approach of covering content imported _into_ Drupal, content exported _out of_ Drupal as well as bulk _copying_ or _transfer_ of Drupal content. The concept of _content_ here covers the content of the entity fields (for example the fields in the nodes, content types, taxonomies or menu items that are usually stored in the database) as well as the content of files referenced in Drupal (including images and other media files).

A challenge during import and export is how to handle references to objects, whether it be references to entities like nodes or references to files. This is important when determining the order of import or export of assets. In other words, there needs to be an instance or at least an address of the referenced object (e.g., node or file) before the procedure can create a reference pointer to that object. Some modules address this complexity and some do not.

#### Groupings of Modules in List

The modules in this list are grouped into the following categories.

* [Modules Associated with the Core Migrate Module](#CoreMigrate)
* [Modules Associated with the Deploy Module](#DeployModule)
* [Modules Primarily for Import from Files](#ImportFromFiles)
* [Modules Primarily for Export to Files](#ExportToFiles)
* [Other Modules for Deployment (that do not fit neatly in above categories)](#OtherModules)

#### Modules Associated with the Core Migrate Module

These modules require the [migrate module](https://www.drupal.org/docs/core-modules-and-themes/core-modules/migrate-module) in Drupal core and possibly other migrate related modules. In general, these are a mature set of modules that use the Extract-Transform-Load pattern to import data from an outside source into a Drupal site. The outside source could be another Drupal site, a database, one or more files (e.g., Excel, CSV, XML, ODS) or a source that you define yourself. This approach is powerful and [well documented](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/api/migrate-api/migrate-api-overview), but it also requires somewhat of a learning curve and usually some custom programming to effectively use its capabilities. Note also that this addresses only _importing_ data into a Drupal site, not exporting.

#### Modules Associated with the Deploy Module

The goal of the [Deploy module](https://drupal.org/project/deploy) is to simplify the process of deploying content from one Drupal site to another associated Drupal site, for example from a staging site to a live site. There are several other modules that are used in conjunction with the Deploy module and are listed in the table below.

#### Modules Primarily for Import from Files

These modules import data from external files (e.g., CSV files) into Drupal. These modules address importing field data and in some cases have features for importing files as well under the right conditions.

#### Modules Primarily for Export to Files

These modules export data to external files (e.g., CSV files) from Drupal. These modules address exporting field data, which may include filenames and file paths for files.

#### Other Modules for Deployment

These modules address different use cases, such as transferring field data from one Drupal site to another or backing up an entire Drupal site for deployment as another site. Some of these may not fall neatly into the categories defined as importing or exporting content, but are deemed close enough to those use cases that they are included here for completeness.

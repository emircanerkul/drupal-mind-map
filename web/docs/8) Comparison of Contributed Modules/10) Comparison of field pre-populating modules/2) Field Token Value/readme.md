Creates a Field type and widget, allowing a field to be created, and defining the value via tokens.

An example of when this module could be useful is if you want to combine the output of multiple fields for use in Views, or providing tokens within an additional string like "This page was last updated on `[node:changed]`".

**Note**: The input field with the default value in the create/edit form is hidden.

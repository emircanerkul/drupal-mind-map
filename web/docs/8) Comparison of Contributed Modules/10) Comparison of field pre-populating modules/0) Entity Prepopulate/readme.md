Prepopulate any entity field with values containing tokens.

* Works on the entity, not form level, which is more robust.
* All prepopulation is explicit, which is good for security.
* Works with multi-property fields (think geofield) out of the box.

Built as successor of _Prepopulate_ module. It works only for entity forms though, so for non-entity forms, use that.

We don't talk about "nodes" every day, but since they are at the heart of Drupal's design, they deserve further investigation. Essentially, a node is a set of related bits of information. When you create a new blog post, you are not only defining its body text, but also its title, content, author link, creation date, taxonomy (tags), etc. Some of these elements will be shown by the theme layer when the node is displayed. Others are meta-data that control when the node will show up at all - such as taxonomy or publishing status.

As suggested before, you aren't limited to a single way of presenting your site's content. You can define many navigation schemes, custom themes, or designs for the site. You can look at some contributed themes [here](https://www.drupal.org/project/Themes).

Comments also illustrate the Drupal way. Comments are typically thought of as part of a blogging system, but there isn't a separate "blogging system" in Drupal. Drupal simply manipulates nodes to function in a manner that most people think of as a blog. But comments can be enabled on any content type (or node) you choose - be it blog posts, news items, book pages (which provide basic wiki features), or any other type you may create. Drupal's modular system is limited only to the imagination of the site builder.

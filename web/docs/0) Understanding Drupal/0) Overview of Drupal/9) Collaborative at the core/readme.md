Creating an informational website that broadcasts from “one to many” is something that most CMSs do right out of the box. Drupal shines, however, by empowering site users to create content and to interact with each other - moving from "one to many" to "many to many."

With some CMSs, you can set up a blog and you can install plugins to handle having a community of users. But what happens when you want to give individual blogs to each of your users, sorting their contents so that they can be displayed individually with their own skins, while also generating cross-blog topical digests, top five lists and links to elaborate, customized user profiles? What if you also want to integrate those blogs with forums, a wiki-like environment and user-owned galleries of tagged photos? A typical CMS's approach to information makes such a scenario very difficult to implement. In contrast, the Drupal way makes such a scenario not only easy to establish but also incredibly manageable over time.

Drupal is designed from the ground up so site builders can delegate content creation and even site administration, to users. All a site builder has to do is define user permissions for which users get to do what and then everyone can start collaborating.

Codebase: These are the files and folders you get when you download Drupal. These files in the codebase are responsible for creating and managing all of your site's content, such as articles, or user comments, The content itself (as well as settings and config) is stored in the database.

When you want to duplicate or move a Drupal site, you need to grab a copy of both the codebase and database.

Hundreds of projects specified their Drupal 9 plan, which are shown on their project pages. This is the easiest place to learn about a project's plan for the new major version. The [Drupal 9 compatibility tag](https://www.drupal.org/project/issues/search?projects=&project%5Fissue%5Ffollowers=&issue%5Ftags%5Fop=%3D&issue%5Ftags=Drupal+9+compatibility) is being used on issues all across contributed projects, so you can use that list to find issues. [Further combining with the Novice tag](https://www.drupal.org/project/issues/search?projects=&project%5Fissue%5Ffollowers=&status%5B%5D=Open&issue%5Ftags%5Fop=all+of&issue%5Ftags=Drupal+9+compatibility%2C+Novice) will show issues that are likely easier to work on.

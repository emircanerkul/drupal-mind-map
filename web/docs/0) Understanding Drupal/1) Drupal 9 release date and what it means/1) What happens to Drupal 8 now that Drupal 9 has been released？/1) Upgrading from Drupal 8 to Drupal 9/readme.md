Upgrading to Drupal 9 is a matter of running update.php _so long as your codebase does not use deprecated APIs_. There are [tools available](https://www.drupal.org/docs/9/how-to-prepare-your-drupal-7-or-8-site-for-drupal-9/deprecation-checking-and-correction-tools) that will identify and fix deprecated APIs in your codebase. You can also work on Drupal.org with the maintainers of contributed projects and themes to make those projects Drupal 9-compatible. Many project pages have a Drupal 9 plan issue linked in a dedicated section. Status of contributed projects can be followed in [the deprecation status tracker](https://dev.acquia.com/drupal9/deprecation%5Fstatus).

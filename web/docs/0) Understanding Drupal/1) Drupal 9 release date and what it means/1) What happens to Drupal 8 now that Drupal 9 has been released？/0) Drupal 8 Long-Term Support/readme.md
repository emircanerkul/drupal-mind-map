Drupal 8 is dependent on Symfony 3, and [Symfony 3's end of life is November 2021](https://symfony.com/roadmap/3.4). Consequently, Drupal 8 support will end in [November 2, 2021](https://www.drupal.org/psa-2020-06-24). A long-term-support (LTS) Drupal 8.9 minor release was released alongside Drupal 9 and will be supported until November 2021\. Drupal 8 will only receive patch releases following Drupal 9.0.0's release. No new features will be added to Drupal 8, nor will minor releases be made available.

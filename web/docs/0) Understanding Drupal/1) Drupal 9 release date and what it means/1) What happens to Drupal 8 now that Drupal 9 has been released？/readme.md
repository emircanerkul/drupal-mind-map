  Drupal 8 Long-Term Support Drupal 8 is dependent on Symfony 3, and Symfony 3's
  end of life is November 2021. Consequently, Drupal 8 support will end in
  November 2, 2021. A long-term-support (LTS) Drupal 8.9 minor release was
  released alongside Drupal 9 and will be supported until November 2021. Drupal
  8 will only receive patch releases following Drupal 9.0.0's release. No new
  features will be added to Drupal 8, nor will minor releases be made available.

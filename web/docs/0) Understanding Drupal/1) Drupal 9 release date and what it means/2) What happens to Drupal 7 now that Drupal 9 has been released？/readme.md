description: >-
  Drupal 7 community support is provided until November 2023 In the past, after
  a new major version, support would only be kept for the prior major version
  (such as Drupal 6 becoming end-of-life shortly after the release of Drupal 8).
  In light of the impact of COVID-19 on our community, Drupal 7 is supported
  until November 1, 2023. This means Drupal 7 will be supported throughout
  Drupal 9's life. Stable migration support for core modules is a requirement of
  Drupal 9, and that even includes a supported migration path from Drupal 6.

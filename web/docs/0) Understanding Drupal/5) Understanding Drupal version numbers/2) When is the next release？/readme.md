New stable releases of Drupal core are scheduled to occur within particular release "windows":

* A bug fix (patch) release window is on the first Wednesday of each month
* A security release window is on the third Wednesday of each month
* For Drupal 8 and above, minor (feature) releases are scheduled approximately every six months, usually on either the first or third Wednesday of that month

For detailed information on these types of releases, see the [Drupal core release cycle overview](https://www.drupal.org/core/release-cycle-overview).

A release window does _not_ necessarily mean that a release will actually be made on that date, but it exists so that site administrators can know in advance which days they should be looking out for.

Exceptions to the above schedule may be made in a case of security vulnerabilities being actively exploited in the wild, critical bugs that prevent Drupal from being used, holidays, etc. When appropriate, changes will be announced in advance via [Planet Drupal](http://drupal.org/planet) (and also via the [Drupal core group](http://groups.drupal.org/core)).

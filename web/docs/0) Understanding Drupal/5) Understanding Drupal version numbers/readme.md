  This guide documents Drupal’s version numbering scheme for contributed modules
  and themes. The contents of the guide are intended to help you understand what
  the various version numbers mean, and how you can use that information when
  building a Drupal site. The Drupal (core) version numbering scheme is simple
  enough: Major.Minor.Patch - for example 8.8.5. The major version number
  indicates compatibility, the minor version number indicates new significant
  features and the patch number indicates bug fixes and minor enhancements.

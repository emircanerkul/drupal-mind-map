CKEditor 4 and 5 are two entirely different codebases. Drupal 8 and 9 both include CKEditor 4\. Security support for that version will end around the time of Drupal 9's end-of-life. [Therefore, Our plan is to include CKEditor 5 in a future version of Drupal 9, deprecate CKEditor 4 in Drupal 9 and remove it in Drupal 10](https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/issues/2966864). This longer deprecation timeframe is due to the new architecture of CKEditor 5, as that will necessitate some work for modules that integrate with it.

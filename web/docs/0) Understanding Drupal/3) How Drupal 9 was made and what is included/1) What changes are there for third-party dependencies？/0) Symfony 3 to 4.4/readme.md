Drupal 9's release date is planned to ensure security support for our most important third party dependency, Symfony. Since [Symfony 3 will be end-of-life in November 2021](https://symfony.com/roadmap/3.4), Drupal 9 is updated to Symfony 4.4\. While Symfony 5 is now available, the disruption of jumping from Symfony 3 to 5 was too great for Drupal 9's release; however, we will try to ensure Drupal 9 is as forward-compatible with Symfony 5 as possible.

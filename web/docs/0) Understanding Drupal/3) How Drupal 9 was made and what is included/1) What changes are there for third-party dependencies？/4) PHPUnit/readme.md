Drupal 8 deprecated our own SimpleTest testing system in favor of the well-known PHPUnit. Drupal 9 r[equires PHPUnit 8](https://www.drupal.org/node/3113653) and work has been done to add a [forward-compatibility layer for PHPUnit 9](https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/issues/3110543). PHPUnit updates their PHP requirements strictly according to the [support provided by PHP](https://www.php.net/supported-versions.php), which may be faster than some production sites can update their requirements. For this reason, we may have to further update Drupal 9's PHPUnit compatibility after 9.0.0's release.

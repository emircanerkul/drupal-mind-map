  Drupal 8 depends on various backend and frontend libraries. Our approach to
  implementing dependency updates is making Drupal 8 as compatible as possible
  with these updated versions. This allows sites to test with these updated
  dependencies, but the required dependency versions remain intact so backwards
  compatibility is ensured. Drupal has various dependencies and this list may
  not be exhaustive. Most of Drupal 9's significant dependency updates are
  listed in the Drupal 9.0.0-beta1 release notes.

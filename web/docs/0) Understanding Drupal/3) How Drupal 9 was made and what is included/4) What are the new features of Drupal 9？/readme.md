description: >-
  Drupal 9.0 has the same features Drupal 8.9 (other than those provided by
  updated dependencies). Similar to Drupal 8, Drupal 9.1, 9.2, etc. will add new
  backwards-compatible features to Drupal 9 every six months after Drupal 9.0.
  The key benefit of Drupal 9 over Drupal 8 is the platform will be supported
  with security fixes after November 2021. The standout feature of Drupal 9 is
  its ability to provide as easy an upgrade as feasible from Drupal 8. Drupal
  9.1 onwards will continue adding new features to Drupal core.

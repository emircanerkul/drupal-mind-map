  The Place Blocks and SimpleTest modules have been removed from core. In both
  cases, a better solution is now available: Read the change record on the Place
  Blocks module's deprecation for improved solutions for block placement. To
  learn more about converting SimpleTests to PHPUnit, read Converting D7 and D8
  SimpleTests to Drupal 8 PHPUnit tests. Additional modules and themes will be
  deprecated in Drupal 9 and removed from Drupal 10, including the Stable theme
  (Drupal 8 version), possibly the Classy theme, and other modules and themes as
  Drupal 9 evolves.

* To learn more about converting SimpleTests to PHPUnit, read [Converting D7 and D8 SimpleTests to Drupal 8 PHPUnit tests](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/testing/converting-d7-and-d8-simpletests-to-drupal-8-phpunit-tests).

Additional modules and themes will be deprecated in Drupal 9 and removed from Drupal 10, including the _Stable_ theme (Drupal 8 version), [possibly the _Classy_ theme](https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/issues/3050378), and other modules and themes as Drupal 9 evolves.

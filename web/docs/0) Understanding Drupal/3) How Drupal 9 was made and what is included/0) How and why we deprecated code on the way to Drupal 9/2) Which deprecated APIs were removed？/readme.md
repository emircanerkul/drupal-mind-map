We removed nearly all deprecated APIs to the Drupal 9.0.0 release, and changed the remaining small number of deprecations to be deprecated for Drupal 10 instead. [See a list of all things marked for deprecation in 8.9.x on api.drupal.org](https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/deprecated/8.9.x), including deprecations in dependencies such as Twig and Symfony. (All deprecations present in the 8.9.x branch have been removed from Drupal 9.0.0.)

description: >-
  Drupal 9 was mostly built in Drupal 8 using deprecations and optional updated
  dependency support. Unlike previous new major versions, Drupal 9 is not a
  reinvention of Drupal. There are only two key differences in Drupal 9: Updates
  of dependencies to versions that stay supported. Removal of our own code that
  we deprecated with removal before Drupal 9's release. Other than these two
  things, Drupal 9.0 is same as Drupal 8.9, the last Drupal 8 minor release. To
  illustrate this, imagine your website is a train. Previously, moving major
  versions meant moving the train to a different track entirely.

2. Removal of our own code that we deprecated with removal before Drupal 9's release.

Other than these two things, Drupal 9.0 is same as Drupal 8.9, the last Drupal 8 minor release.

To illustrate this, imagine your website is a train. Previously, moving major versions meant moving the train to a different track entirely. Beginning with Drupal 9, new major versions will just be stations on the same track.

There is an experimental feature to toggle high contrast mode. When enabled, this adds borders to sections of the admin area to help improve visibility. Areas that have borders applied to them are field sets, vertical toolbar menus, forms, tables, and some divisions. This feature works in both Light and Dark mode.

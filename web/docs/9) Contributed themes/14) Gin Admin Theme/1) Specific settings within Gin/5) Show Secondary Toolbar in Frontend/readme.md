To use this option, ensure that you have downloaded the [Gin toolbar](https://www.drupal.org/project/gin%5Ftoolbar) helper module. If your website is managed via Composer install it by running the following command in your terminal, then enable it:

```yaml
composer require 'drupal/gin_toolbar'
```

Toggling ‘Show Secondary Toolbar in Frontend’ places an additional horizontal toolbar on the front end of your site and is positioned at the top of the page that is fixed. As the page is scrolled it remains in view.

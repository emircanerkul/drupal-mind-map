We can change the appearance of the admin interface to suit the requirements of the end user. For example, some people might prefer dark backgrounds over light backgrounds to help with visibility and ease eye strain.

There are three modes to choose from:

* Light
* Dark
* Auto

‘Light’ mode will ensure that light background colors are used in conjunction with dark foreground text, and ‘Dark’ mode ensures that dark background colors are used in conjunction with light foreground text.

Also, Gin can be configured to automatically adapt to a color scheme based on a preference mode defined at the operating system level. To do this, select ‘Auto’.

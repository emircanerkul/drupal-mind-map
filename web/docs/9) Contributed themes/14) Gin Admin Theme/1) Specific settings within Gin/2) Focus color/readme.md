There is the ability to change the focus color, in this section, there are several options to choose from and should be self-explanatory.

They are:

* Gin Focus color (Default)
* Green
* Claro Green
* Orange
* Neutral
* Same as Accent color
* Custom

If you have already set an accent color you can opt to use the same color for focusing by choosing the option ‘Same as Accent color’ from the select list. If the accent color is custom, it will also match it.

A custom color can be set by choosing the ‘Custom’ option from the select list and then entering a HEX color reference. As noted with selecting an accent color, please consider a11y criteria so that it contrasts appropriately.

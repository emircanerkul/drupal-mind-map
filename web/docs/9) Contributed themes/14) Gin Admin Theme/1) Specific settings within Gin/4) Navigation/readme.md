There are three options which will change the position of the admin navigation toolbar.

* Sidebar, Vertical Toolbar (Default)
* Horizontal, Modern Toolbar
* Legacy, Classic Drupal Toolbar

### Sidebar, Vertical Toolbar

‘Sidebar, Vertical Toolbar’ will position the toolbar to the left-hand side of the screen. Located at the very bottom is a button that expands the menu revealing the names of the navigation items. Toggling it again will collapse the menu to just show the icons.

### Horizontal, Modern Toolbar

‘Horizontal, Modern Toolbar’ positions the toolbar to the top of the screen which is fixed and always in view when the page is scrolled.

We can choose from a selection of predefined accent colors that will influence the color of HTML elements such as form buttons, input items, labels, select lists etc. Accent colors can be used in either Light or Dark mode.

If a color from the predefined list is not suitable then a custom color can be set by choosing the ‘transparent’ item at the end of the list and entering a HEX color reference.

Please consider your color choice carefully as it should meet a11y criteria and contrast appropriately. [This](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) tool is available to help meet your desired standard level.

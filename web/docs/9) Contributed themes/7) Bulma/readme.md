  Bulma is a Drupal 8 base theme built on the Bulma CSS framework, which is
  itself built on the Flexbox model of modern CSS available in all current
  browsers. The Bulma CSS framework can be considered "environment agnostic":
  the style layer on top of the logic. There is no JavaScript included with the
  Bulma CSS framework. In the Bulma Drupal base theme we try to follow this
  behavior. An exception has been made to make mobile menus work, but all
  additional JS logic will be when possible accepted as documentation,
  suggestions, subthemes, or modules, but not directly in the base theme.

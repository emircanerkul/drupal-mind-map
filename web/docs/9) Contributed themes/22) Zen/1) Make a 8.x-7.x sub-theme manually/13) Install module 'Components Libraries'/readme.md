### Module installation overview

The easiest way to install this module, or any module or theme (that does not need to be modified), is to go to either your site's 'Appearance' page, or to your site's 'Extend' (modules) page, and click the button "Install new theme/Install new module". Paste the URL you copied from any drupal.org 'project' page into your box 'Install from a URL', and click the button "Install".

Otherwise, you can, of course, extract the module into your folder `[D8-root]/modules/*`. Check to see that, for example, the file 'components.info.yml' is at `[D8-root]/modules/components/components.info.yml`, and if so, you can be confident that the module is properly placed.

**Get the URL for (or download) 'Component Libraries' from the page:**

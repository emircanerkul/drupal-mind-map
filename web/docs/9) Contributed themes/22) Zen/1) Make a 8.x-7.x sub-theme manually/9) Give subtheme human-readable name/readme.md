Edit the renamed file "my\_zen\_sub.info.yml" (originally "STARTERKIT.info.yml"). Change the line  
`name: Zen Sub-theme Starter Kit`  
 to whatever you like, as for example,  
`name: My Zen Sub`  
 so that your new subtheme will hava a name that is different from an additional subtheme named 'Zen Sub-theme Starter Kit' that will be automatically included with the Zen base theme installation.

You will see the automatically generated subtheme named 'Zen Sub-theme Starter Kit' on the 'Appearance' page. It is, in essence, being generated by the existence of the original folder 'STARTERKIT' inside the 'zen' base-theme folder.

The text you use following `name:`, as for example, `My Zen Subtheme`, will be the name of your subtheme that you will see displayed on the 'Appearance' page.

"Keep in short."

I recommend that you use a short 'name:' in that line of code, because that 'name:' is what will be displayed on the sub-tab for this theme at the top of the appearance 'Settings' page; and you do not necessarily want that tab running off the page to the right when your browser is very narrow, as when using a small mobile device.

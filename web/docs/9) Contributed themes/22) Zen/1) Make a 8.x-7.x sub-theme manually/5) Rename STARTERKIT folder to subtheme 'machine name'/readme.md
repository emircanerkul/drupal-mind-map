Decide upon a 'machine' name for your subtheme. This machine name will not be seen by your site visitors. It will only be used by the Drupal 8 system.

The machine name for your subtheme must begin with a lower-case alphabetic character (a to z), and can only use lower-case alphabetic characters, numerals (0 to 9), and underscores (\_). \[Nothing else, including NO spaces\]

Rename the STARTERKIT folder using your new 'machine' name, as, for example, to  
`my_zen_sub`

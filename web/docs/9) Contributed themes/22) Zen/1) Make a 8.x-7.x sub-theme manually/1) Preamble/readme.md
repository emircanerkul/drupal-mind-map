* Editing the files on your computer: This guide will be based on your copying and editing files on your computer, and Not doing that editing online, Nor using Drush, and Not using the command line in any fashion.
* The 'machine name' `my_zen_sub` will be used as the example in this Guide.
* `[D8-root]/themes/zen` and `[D8-root]/themes/my_zen_sub` will be the locations referred to in this guide for the Zen base-theme folder 'zen', and the sub-theme folder 'my\_zen\_sub'.  
These are the locations where they will eventually reside in your Drupal 8 codebase, but it does not matter where you have them on your computer as you edit them.

**Optional sub-folders within the 'themes' folder**

Alternatively, some people like to create sub-folders in their `[d8-root]/themes` folder, to organize their Non-core themes. That will be discussed in more detail below in the help-box ["Optional sub-folders of the 'themes' folder" â¤µ](#optional%5Ftheme%5Fsub-folders)

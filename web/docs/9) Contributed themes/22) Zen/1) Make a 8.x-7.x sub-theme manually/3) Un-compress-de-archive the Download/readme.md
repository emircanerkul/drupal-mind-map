I do not know about MAC or Linux, but Windows 7, 8, and 10 have a built in de-compression/de-archiving program that can extract the folders/files contained in a \*.zip file.

* **Windows**, by default, is Not able to create a single 'archived/compressed' file from a set of folders/files you have on your computer, and that is an ability that you may want to have for use later in this guide to make it easier and faster to upload your Zen subtheme to an online webhost or server.

I use the free program '7-Zip' (Windows or Linux, only), which is about four-times faster at de-compression than the Windows built-it program, and which can create a archived/compressed file in a variety of different formats.

**Free Compression/De-compression (Achive/De-archive) Software; and Other Freeware You May Need or Want \[Linux, MAC, Windows\]**

If you need a program for **Windows or Linux** that can 'archive/compress' or 'de-compress/de-archive' every file of this type that you are likely to come across, including but not limited to \*.zip, \*.tar.gz, or \*.rar files, I recommend the freeware program [7-Zip Homepage/Downloads \~ 7-zip.org](http://www.7-zip.org "   This link opens in a new tab/window.  ~ [http://www.7-zip.org/] ") (This link opens in a new tab/window.)

For more information on various other free de-archive/archiving programs, including for **MAC**, go to the page [Best Free File Archiver Or Zip Utility \[\~ Gizmo's freeware reviews at techsupportalert.com](http://www.techsupportalert.com/best-free-file-archiver-zip-utility.htm "   This link opens in a new tab/window.  ~ [techsupportalert.com/best-free-file-archiver-zip-utility.htm] ") (This link opens in a new tab/window.)

**For all my freeware needs**, I start at that last site's homepage [Gizmo's freeware reviews \~ techsupportalert.com](http://www.techsupportalert.com/ "   This link opens in a new tab/window.  ~ [http://www.techsupportalert.com] ") (This link opens in a new tab/window.)

Use that page's top-right corner 'search' feature, which is a text-field box you can type in if your window is wide enough, or, if your window is thin, as for example, on a mobile device, the website's 'search' is accessed by clicking the 'magnifying-glass' icon.

That site is by far the best I have found for freeware research, and I have been using it for years.

**Extract the 'zen' folder from the file you downloaded**

**Windows \*.zip file de-archive process example**

* **7-Zip**: If you have 7-Zip installed, RIGHT-click on your downloaded \*.zip Zen file. In the drop-down 'context' menu, hover your mouse pointer on the menu item '7-Zip', and in the second menu, click "Extract Here".  
That should create a single folder named 'zen' within the same folder that the \*.zip file resides.
* **Using the Windows built-in native extractor**: RIGHT-click on your downloaded \*.zip Zen file. In the drop-down 'context' menu, click "Extract All...".  
That process will create a folder based on the name of the compressed file. For example, the file 'zen-8.x-7.0-alpha14.zip' will create a folder named 'zen-8.x-7.0-alpha14'. Within the folder 'zen-8.x-7.0-alpha14' you will find a single folder named 'zen'. Pull the folder 'zen' out, and delete the empty folder 'zen-8.x-7.0-alpha14'.

Regardless of whatever computer system you are using, or whatever method you use, at this point you need to have the folder 'zen', complete with all of the folders and files it contains, extracted on your computer.

If you have Drupal running on your computer, put the 'zen' folder at `[D8-root]/themes/zen`.

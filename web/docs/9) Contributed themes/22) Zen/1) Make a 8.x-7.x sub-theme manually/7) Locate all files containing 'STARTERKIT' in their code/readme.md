With 'zen-8.x-7.0-alpha14' (and 'zen-8.x-7.x-dev (2016-Jul-14)'), there are 138-occurrences of the code 'STARTERKIT' within 48-files in your subtheme folder. (That does not include the 49th file 'README.txt' at `[d8-root]/my_zen_sub/README.txt`, which itself contains an additional 6-occurrences)

Hey. I heard that. Not so loud. "This is a neighborhood. This ain't no residential district". \[quote by Richard Pryor\] (Assuming, as I am, that you reacted as can be expected, you do not want to scare the kids, or startle the neighbors with profanity at that volume.)

No problems, no worries. All of those replacements can be made with one-click of the mouse.

### To replace all occurrences of a text 'string' in multiple files:

**Overview:**

* Use a 'locate' program that lets you select a single folder, including that folder's subfolders, and which searches that folder for all of the files that contain a specific 'string' of text, namely, the text "STARTERKIT".  
Drag that list of located files into...
* A programming/text editor that has the ability to replace one specific piece of code with another, in all of its open files.

**The process in detail:**

Search your subtheme folder for all occurrences of 'STARTERKIT' using one of the [Best Free Desktop Search Utility \[\~ Gizmo's freeware reviews at techsupportalert.com\]](http://www.techsupportalert.com/best-free-desktop-search-utility.htm "   This link opens in a new tab/window.  ~ [domain/url] ") (This link opens in a new tab/window.).

I use the desktop search utility 'Locate32' (Windows only).

After your search is complete, highlight all of the files in the search results, and then de-select 'README.txt'.

**File download location on your computer**

Before you download Zen, if you need help controlling where files are downloaded and saved onto your computer, see the detailed guide here: [Know your browser's file-download location; or change browser's download location. \~ drupal.org](https://www.drupal.org/node/1248034#dl%5Flocation "   This link opens in a new tab/window.  ~ [https://www.drupal.org/node/1248034#dl_location] ") (This link opens in a new tab/window.)

Go to the drupal.org projects homepage for Zen,  
[Zen \~ \[drupal.org/project/zen\]](https://www.drupal.org/project/zen "   This link opens in a new tab/window.  ~ [domain/url] "). (This link opens in a new tab/window)

Scroll to the bottom of the page. Look for the heading 'Downloads', under which are the sub-headings 'Recommended releases', 'Other releases', and 'Development releases'.

Look for the upper-most 'Version' that you can find for '`8.x-X.0-...`'.

If you see a 'Recommended releases' version, then that is what you will want to use for your live website. (Live websites are also known as 'production' sites-- as opposed to 'development' or 'test' sites.)

**Currently...**

* Currently, the most stable version is under the heading 'Other releases', and is the 'Version' `8.x-7.0-alpha14`. This is a 'pre-release version', and is Not recommended for 'production' sites.  
Just to inject a bit of confusion for you, I have found that the development version `8.x-7.x-dev` under the sub-heading 'Development releases' (currently listed with '2016-Jul-14' in the 'Date' column), performs similarly to the version '8.x-7.0-alpha14', per my very limited experience.  
I consider both of those versions as being suited only for testing, and would recommend to you that you use the 'Other releases - alpha14' version, unless you, like me, would like to test the 'Dev' version with the intent of relaying all problems you find to the developers via the [Zen 'issues que' for Drupal 8 \~ drupal.org/project/issues/zen?version=8.x](https://www.drupal.org/project/issues/zen?version=8.x "   This link opens in a new tab/window. [~ drupal.org/project/issues/zen] ") (after first 'searching' to see if the problem has already been reported.)

**\*.tar.gz versus \*.zip**

Zen comes to you 'achived' (as a single file), and 'compressed' (small as possible) in two different formats: \*.tar.gz, and \*.zip.

Either one of these archived/compressed files contains everything needed for the theme 'Zen'. Both contain the exact same set of folders and files. One type might work better on your system than the other, and the \*.tar.gz is smaller because of its better system of compression. And so, if one gives you a problem, use the other.

* **Windows:** If you are using a Windows computer, I recommend that you download the 'zip' file.  
Windows does not by default include a program that can extract \*.tar.gz files. The extraction from a \*.tar.gz file requires you to install a third-party program, like the freeware program 7-Zip (Windows, Linux). And, even with 7-Zip, extracting a \*.tar.gz file on Windows is a two-step process that requires you to first de-compress it to a \*.tar file, which itself will then need to be de-archived to the final set of folders and files.

('7-Zip' for Windows and Linux, and other de-archive programs, including for MAC, are discussed in more detail below.)

**To start the Zen download...**

After you decide upon either the 'alpha14' or the 'dev' version, (or the 'Recommended release' version if that has become available) click either the text-link "`tar.gz (xxx.xx KB)`", or the text-link "`zip (xxx.xx KB)`" for that version.

That will start the download of the compressed/archived file.

'Save' it wherever you like on your computer.

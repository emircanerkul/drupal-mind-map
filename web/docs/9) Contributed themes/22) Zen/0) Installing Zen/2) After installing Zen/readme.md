**You do not need to 'enable' the Zen theme** for it to function as a base-theme for the Zen sub-theme you will create next.

The base-theme Zen will automatically move out of the 'Appearance' page section 'Uninstalled themes' and into the section 'Installed themes' after you click "Install" or "Install and set as default" on the 'Appearance' page for any Zen subtheme.

**Warning if using 'Zen 8.x-7.0-alpha14', or 'Zen 8.x-7.x-dev (2016-Jul-14)'**: Do NOT set the base-theme Zen as the 'Administration theme' at the bottom of the 'Appearance' page; and do Not have the 'Administration theme' set to "Default theme" and then click "Set as default" for the base-theme Zen. That will thoroughly break your site, and although the site can be recovered, Zen and Zen subthemes will no longer work on the site. See issue: <https://www.drupal.org/node/2769557>

If you want to check out Zen as your site's default theme before you decide to create a Zen subtheme, just make sure that the 'Administration theme' at the bottom of the 'Appearance' page is not set to 'Default theme'-- before you click "Install and set as default" (when it is in the section 'Uninstalled themes'), or before you click "Set as default" (when it is in the section 'Installed themes')

You can, however, set your Zen subtheme as the 'Administration theme' without worry after you create it.

**You will next create a Zen sub-theme** for any modifications you want to make to Zen. See [Create a Zen sub-theme](/node/873778).

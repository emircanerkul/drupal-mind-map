  By default, Drulma is configured to download the Bulma CSS library and BulmaJS
  from a CDN so the theme doesn't require additional steps to be displayed
  correcly. This way including Bulma inside Drulma source code is avoided.
  Loading from a CDN is fine but it has limitations and drawbacks. Once Bulma is
  hosted locally it allows for it to be compiled and configured so it can be
  served adjusted to the requirements. First option: using Libraries Provider
  One choice to be able to configure Bulma is to use the Libraries provider
  module.

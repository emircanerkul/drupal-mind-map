description: >-
  Drupal 8 has a great support for REST resources, but they should be configured
  first. The aim of the module is to use Drupal's functionality and already
  contributed modules, and providing easy way of setting up necessary endpoints
  and other utilities for Reactify theme. It can be used as example of
  implementing own solutions depending on one's requirements for their project.
  The module adds REST endpoints, authentication, CRUD endpoints for users,
  content and comments. Provides example of implementing custom entities, what
  would be suitable for web applications.

Your custom D8F6 theme has been packed with some great features for speeding up your development and ensuring some quality and process in your workflow.

<!-- note-warning -->
> WARNING: There is the ability to use vanilla CSS and inherit styles and features from the ZURB Foundation parent theme. However, these instruction deal specifically with styling your theme using SASS. We highly recommend this method, as there are lots of great reasons for using SASS, splitting up your styles into logical chunks and letting the pre-packages npm dependencies compile your code.

In order to install them, you'll need to go to the [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), download and run the installer (select the LTS version). This will install Node.js for this and any other project that used NPM.

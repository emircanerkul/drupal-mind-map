Use the following drush command to set your new subtheme as the default theme:

```php
drush vset theme_default mycustomtheme
```

Now if you log in to your Drupal website in your browser and navigate to the **Appearance** tab, you'll see your subtheme.

Set it to **enabled** and set to **default** (if you haven't already, enable the ZURB Foundation theme as well).

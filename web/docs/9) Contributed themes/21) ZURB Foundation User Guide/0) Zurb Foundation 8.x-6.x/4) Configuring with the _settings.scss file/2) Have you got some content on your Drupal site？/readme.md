At this stage, creating some content types, adding some content and creating some main navigation (menu) links would be a great idea, so you can see your website take shape as you begin configuring the many features of your Drupal ZURB Foundation subtheme.

### Here are some ideas for content to create

* Heading (H1, H2, H3, H4 and so on)
* Paragraphs
* Ordered and unordered lists
* Links
* Buttons
* Tables
* Main menu
* Multi-column content (ie. content that you want to display in two, three or four columns - you could also create a View displaying multiple nodes)
* Content that you want to display differently at different breakpoints

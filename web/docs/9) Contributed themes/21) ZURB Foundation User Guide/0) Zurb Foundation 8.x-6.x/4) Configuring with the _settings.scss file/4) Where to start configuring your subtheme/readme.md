Your front-end will be looking pretty blank at the moment, and your content will be styled with default Foundation styling.

### Start your compiler

It's a great idea right now to start your compiler to watch for changes to your subtheme files. In Terminal:

```php
gulp watch
```

### Configure Foundation features by editing the settings.scss file

The _web/themes/custom/scss/\_settings.scss_ file is the primary file for configuring all the features of Foundation. If you're a Foundation beginner, this is a great place to start to check out all the features offered by Foundation.

In your favourite text editor ([Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com) etc), open the _\_settings.scss_ file.

Scroll through the _\_settings.scss_ file and adjust all the variables to taste. You'll find lost of comments and logical variable names to help explain what each set of variables does.

We HIGHLY recommend that you use the ZURB Foundation theme as a parent theme and you create a subtheme, a child theme, to create the look and feel of your website. It's fairly standard practice.

Creating a subtheme is easy and ensures you can update the parent theme while not breaking your subtheme.

\* Just so we're clear, yes, the ZURB Foundation theme is currently in alpha, which means it might not be perfect. We're close to going beta with D8F6, but if you find any bugs or issues, please check to see if there is [an issue in the issue queue](https://www.drupal.org/project/issues/zurb%5Ffoundation?status=All&categories=All), and start a [new issue](https://www.drupal.org/project/issues/zurb%5Ffoundation?status=All&categories=All) if you find something new.

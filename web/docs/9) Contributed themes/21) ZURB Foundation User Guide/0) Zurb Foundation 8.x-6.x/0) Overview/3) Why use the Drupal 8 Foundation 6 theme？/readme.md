Here are some examples of Foundation 6 and itâ€™s application to Drupal 8.

1. Foundations [XY Grid](https://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/xy-grid.html) (as well as the legacy [Flex Grid](https://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/flex-grid.html) and [Float Grid](https://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/grid.html)) allows you to easily lay out any Drupal content in limitless configurations.
2. Foundation's [Top Bar](https://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/top-bar.html) is combined with Drupal's menu navigation and works with sub-menus and sticky navigation.
3. Foundation's [Off Canvas](https://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/off-canvas.html) regions are available as Drupal block regions, and any Menu Blocks placed in those regions will automatically be themed with sub-menu support.
4. Drupal's Status Messages are displayed by default in a Foundation [Callout](https://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/callout.html), but can also be displayed in a Modal window. Both can be closed and removed from the DOM after being displayed.
5. A [Drush command for creating sub-themes](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/modules/zurb-foundation-user-guide/zurb-foundation-8x-6x/using-drush-to-install-zurb) is available for quickly spinning up subthemes as needed (like Drupal Console for subthemes).

One of the greatest advantages of Foundation over its responsive rivals (Bootstrap, Skeleton, Susy, Less Framework, HTML5 Boilerplate, the list goes on) is [its super-easy-to-use documentation](https://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/). The Drupal ZURB Foundation theme leverages this documentation as closely as possible.

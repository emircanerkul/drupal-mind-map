  TL;DR Drupal 8 YAML-based theme combined with Foundation for Sites 6.
  Foundation has awesome documentation and is a great framework for prototype
  and production websites. Use D8F6 as a parent to your own custom, flexible
  subtheme. Includes Gulp: compile/minify Sass and JS; use other useful
  development tools like SASS-lint, source mapping. Utilises SMACSS methodology
  for organising Sass. Install with composer or drush, and use drush to
  automatically create subtheme. Go to the ZURB Foundation project page What is
  Foundation?

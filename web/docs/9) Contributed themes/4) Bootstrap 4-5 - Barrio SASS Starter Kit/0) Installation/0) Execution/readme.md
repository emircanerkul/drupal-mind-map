Just run `gulp`

This will generate a `style.css` file with mappings for debugging and a `style.min.css` file for production. To switch between these two versions you will need to change the reference to the file manually on your `SUBTHEME.libraries.yml` file (and replace `style.min.css` with `style.css` or vice versa).

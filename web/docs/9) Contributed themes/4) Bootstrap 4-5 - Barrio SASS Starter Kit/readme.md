  Bootstrap 4/5 SASS - Barrio Starter Kit is a Barrio sub-theme that simplifies
  integrating Bootstrap 4/5 SASS with Drupal. This sub-theme overrides almost
  every CSS from Drupal and replaces where possible Bootstrap variables in order
  to generate from roots a new set of CSS files. Color management relies on
  Google Material Design, generating lighten and darken variations of the main
  color to generate hover or contrast for main colors. For variables overridden
  the SCSS file is defined, changing the whole Bootstrap definition according to
  the personalizations set.

  Image widget We made a design for the image upload field, we imagine a small
  version of the image can be rendered as the thumbnail. We also styled a
  “drop-in” style, depending on how far WYSIWYG goes this could be part of that
  initiative. Note: The above design of the upload widget is blocked on browser

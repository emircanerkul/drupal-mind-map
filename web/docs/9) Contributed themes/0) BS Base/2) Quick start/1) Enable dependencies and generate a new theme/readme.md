```php
drush en bs_lib
drush then bs_base bs_bootstrap
drush bs-tc bs_bootstrap your_theme 'Your Theme Name' 'Your Theme Description.'
```

And that's it. Your custom theme is generated and you can start having fun with it :)

Make sure to have node, pnpm or npm and gulp-cli installed on your system before using drush generator. Check the [Installation](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/themes/bs-base/installation) section for more details.

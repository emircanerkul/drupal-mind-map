  Multilingual Logo Drupal 8 still does not support branding block multilingual
  logo variations. Because of this bs_base is offering you an option of
  automatic logo switching based on current active site language. For example,
  if you have custom_theme/logo.svg logo file and you are on German language
  theme will automatically check does custom_theme/logo-de.svg file exists and
  if yes it will use that one. This feature works for both regular logo and
  inlined SVG logo.

Drupal 8 still does not support branding block multilingual logo variations.

Because of this bs\_base is offering you an option of automatic logo switching based on current active site language. For example, if you have custom\_theme/logo.svg logo file and you are on German language theme will automatically check does custom\_theme/logo-de.svg file exists and if yes it will use that one.

<!-- note-tip -->
> TIP: This feature works for both regular logo and inlined SVG logo.

  The theme supports responsive off-canvas navigation that is enabled by default
  and positioned on the right side. You have the option to choose the off-canvas
  type and navigation position on the theme settings page: If you disable
  off-canvas type then the theme will use standard Bootstrap navbar responsive
  menu solutions for small screens. Not all options are tested well and some are
  not working currently. Push and Slide options with position Right should work
  OK.

It's recommended to use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#install--update-script) to be able to use different node versions on your system.

To install or update node to for example latest version 10 with latest compatible npm for this version do:

```php
nvm install 10 --latest-npm

```

If you just want to update npm then do:

```php
nvm install-latest-npm
```

  Barrio is a Bootstrap 4/5, Drupal 8 Base Theme, using from roots twig
  templates to completely override Drupal's markup, generating full Bootstrap
  4/5 markup and wiping out almost all Drupal 8 code from the HTML output. This
  theme has no style, rather it creates a layout to serve as a starting point
  for a Base Theme. Several configuration options are available for this theme
  out of the box on its settings form, plus there's unlimited possibilities from
  editing twig templates..

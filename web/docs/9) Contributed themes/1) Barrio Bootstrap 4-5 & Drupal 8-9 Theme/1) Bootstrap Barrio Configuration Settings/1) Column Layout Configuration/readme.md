  Around the content region, Barrio defines two sidebars named as Sidebar First
  and Sidebar Second. The sidebars only appear when content is present on either
  one or both. The width of the columns is defined on the configuration form,
  set at three as default. Columns could be both at left, left and right, or
  both right of the content. Content width is calculated automatically by
  Bootstrap thanks to Flex column handling. By default, sidebars collapse at
  small screen size and for now, that is hardcoded.

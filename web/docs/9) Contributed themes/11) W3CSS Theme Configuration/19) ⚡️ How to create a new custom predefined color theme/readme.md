Go to <https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/w3css%5Fcolor%5Fgenerator.asp> and create your custom private theme. Follow the steps to generate a private theme.

After you finish go to your-drupal-site-directory/themes/custom/your-sub-theme/css/your-css-file-name.css open and paste the generated css inside styles.css.

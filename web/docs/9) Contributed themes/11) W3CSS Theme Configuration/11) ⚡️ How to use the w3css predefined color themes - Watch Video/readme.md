### In W3CSS Theme V2 was changed to a dropdown select list.

Go to your-drupal-site-name/admin/appearance/settings/drupal8\_w3css\_theme and click on w3css predefined color themes to expand it. Copy and paste any of your desired w3css color theme and click save. FYI: if you have any w3 classes in Advanced Site Color Section they will not override the uploaded color theme because of the CSS order. Any predefined theme file it will be loaded after w3.css.

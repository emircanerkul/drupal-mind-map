Create a menu with any name. Example the new menu name is 'Titto'. Add all the links in drupal. **The maximum number of menu levels to show is three. This maximum number includes the initial level**. Level one is always visible. The two levels are hidden and you show them by clicking. Go to d8w3css/templates/navigation and clone menu--responsive-v.html.twig to your sub theme folder and name it menu--titto.html.twig. Clear all caches and you are done.

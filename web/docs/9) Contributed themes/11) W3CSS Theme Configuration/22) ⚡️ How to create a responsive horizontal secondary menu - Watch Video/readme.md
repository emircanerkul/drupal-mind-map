Create a menu with any name. Example the new menu name is 'Titto'. Add all the links as usual in drupal. **The maximum number of menu levels to show is three. This maximum number includes the initial level**. Level one is always visible on screen resolution bigger than 992px. The two levels show on hover. On screen resolution less than 992px all levels are hidden and they show by clicking. Go to d8w3css/templates/navigation and clone menu--responsive-h.html.twig to your sub theme folder and name it menu--titto.html.twig. Clear all caches and you are done.

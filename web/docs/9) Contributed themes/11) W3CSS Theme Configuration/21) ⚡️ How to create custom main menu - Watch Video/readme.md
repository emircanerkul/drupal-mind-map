You don't have to use the default main menu as your main menu. ANY menu can be the main menu.

If you want a horizontal menu just drop ANY menu in the Primary Menu region.

If you want a vertical menu just drop ANY menu in the Primary Menu Vertical region.

You don't have to create any a special template for the vertical or horizontal main menu.

You can use the two regions at once by creating two main menus and use the two regions.

Note: A vertical main menu is different from a side menu in your website. (Example for the vertical menu: <https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/tryw3css%5Ftemplates%5Finterior%5Fdesign.htm>)

A side menu is just a secondary menu you have on your website. The secondary menu can be vertical or horizontal and you can place it in left or right column.

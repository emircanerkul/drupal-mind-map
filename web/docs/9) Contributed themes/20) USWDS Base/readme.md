### Introduction

For: [USWDS - United States Web Design System Base](/project/uswds%5Fbase)

The United States Web Design System (USWDS) is a design system specifically built for Federal Government use. This theme is a way to integrate the styles with Drupal. Complex theming for your project, outside of basic core requirements, should be done through your custom theme.

**\*\*ATTENTION\*\* For the dropdown menus to work properly without being on the page/link, you will have to enable "Show as expanded" on each menu item. For any items needing more than 1 level (Megamenu needs 3 levels), you may need to modify the specific menu block as well.**

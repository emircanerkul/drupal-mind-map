Ok, so you loaded this theme... where is that Hero callout? Well, you're going to have to create the demo yourself.

Go to: Manage > Structure > Blocks > Block Layout

Scroll down to the Hero region and click "Place Block"

Click "Add a Custom Block"

You can call it: USA Hero Callout

Code: \*Please note: You must use Full HTML for this to work properly.  
(Switch to Source)

`<h2 class="usa-hero__heading"><span class="usa-hero__callout--alt">Hero callout:</span>Bring attention to a project priority</h2<p>Support the callout with some short explanatory text. You donâ€™t need more than a couple of sentences.</p> <p><a class="usa-button" href="#hero">Call to action</a></p>`

Save it

You should now be able to click "Configure" to the right of the block in your Hero region. On the configure block page, go to Pages and type in <front> to have your block only appear on the front page.

Go see your work!

  **ATTENTION** - Yes... another one of these. "Show as expanded" must be
  selected on all menu items in order for the menu to show the next level.
  Sidebars are capable of 3 levels, but without "Show as expanded" selected on
  each menu item, you will only see the child menu items when you click and
  navigate to a parent. First Sidebar and Second Sidebar I'm lumping both of
  these together. The first is just a menu on the left of the content and the
  second is a menu on the right of the content. You should only use one or the
  other.

### First Sidebar and Second Sidebar

I'm lumping both of these together. The first is just a menu on the left of the content and the second is a menu on the right of the content. You should only use one or the other.

Drupal comes with various automated testing options to choose from. Most of those are part of core testing framework. And the enriched functionalities and UI is provided by either the new testing framework [PHPUnit](/docs/testing/phpunit-in-drupal "PHPUnit in Drupal | Drupal guide on Drupal.org"). Testing can be done in different layers in order to confirm the quality and reaction of code on edge cases:

1. Unit tests
2. Kernel tests
3. Functional tests

It is also possible to use an external framework like [Behat](https://www.drupal.org/project/drupalextension "Project page on Drupal.org") with scenarios in [Gherkin syntax](https://docs.behat.org/en/v2.5/guides/1.gherkin.html "Writing Features - Gherkin Language â€” Behat 2.5.3 documentation").

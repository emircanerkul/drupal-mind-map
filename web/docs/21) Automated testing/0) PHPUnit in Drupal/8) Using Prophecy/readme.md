  Mocking with Prophecy in PHPUnit Unit testing is a best practice in
  test-driven development. In a unit test, a small part of the code (for
  example, a particular class) is tested and just that. For the other
  interacting code in the test, you inject the dependencies, not as real
  objects, but rather as mocks (simulated objects). Prophecy creates mocks from
  a class. The class methods can be called on these mock objects, which will
  return method mock objects instead of the actual results. In turn,
  expectations can be set on the method mock objects.

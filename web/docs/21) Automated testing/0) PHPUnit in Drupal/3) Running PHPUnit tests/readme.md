  PHPUnit runs all the tests in Drupal 8 and above. Earlier versions of Drupal
  used the Simpletest Module for testing. If you are using Lando, you can skip
  the manual configuration and jump straight to Lando + Drupal Contributions.
  Setting up to run PHPUnit tests Ensure Composer dependencies are installed If
  you installed from a Drupal.org package you have three options: Install
  Composer and run composer install (or try composer update on an existing D8 or
  D9 root). Use a development snapshot (for example, 9.0.x-dev) instead of a
  tagged release for your development site.

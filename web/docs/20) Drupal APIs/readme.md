  Each version of Drupal introduces new APIs and keeps only some of the previous
  major versions’ APIs. Before diving into the documentation below you might
  want to read the background and prerequisites, and the Creating custom modules
  guides, both of which explain some concepts and terminology that will be
  assumed knowledge in the API documentation here. For a crash course, but with
  some real depth, check out Understanding Drupal 8. It provides an overview of
  many of the key APIs introduced in Drupal 8/9.

Each version of Drupal introduces new APIs and keeps only some of the previous major versions’ APIs.

Before diving into the documentation below you might want to read the [background and prerequisites](https://drupal.org/node/2182165), and the [Creating custom modules](/docs/creating-custom-modules) guides, both of which explain some concepts and terminology that will be assumed knowledge in the API documentation here.

For a crash course, but with some real depth, check out [Understanding Drupal 8](https://cipix.nl/understanding-drupal-8-part-1-general-structure-framework). It provides an overview of many of the key APIs introduced in Drupal 8/9.

Finally, review the [Drupal 8 backwards compatibility policy](https://www.drupal.org/core/d8-bc-policy) for an explanation of what may change between minor versions of Drupal 8/9 and what will remain stable.

Every object which uses `Drupal\Core\DependencyInjection\ContainerInjectionInterface` (for example, controllers, forms, and blocks), must implement the `create()` factory method to pass the dependencies into the class constructor. Controllers, forms, and blocks are not defined via the `*.services.yml` file. Check [Dependency Injection for a Form](/docs/8/api/services-and-dependency-injection/dependency-injection-for-a-form).

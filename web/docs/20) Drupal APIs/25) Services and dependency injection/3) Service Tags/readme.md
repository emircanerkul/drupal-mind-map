  About Service Tags Tags are used to indicate that a service should be
  registered or used in some special way, or that it belongs to a category. See
  the Symfony documentation on service tags. The Service Tags API page documents
  the service tags in Drupal core. Help document the service tags. Collecting
  Services Drupal has an API for defining a service collector, which is a
  special type of service that collects other services by tag (these are called
  the collected services).

  The Drupal Plugin API allows a module or subsystem to provide functionality
  (plugin instances) in an object-oriented way. Plugins that perform similar
  functionality are of the same plugin type. Module developers write plugins to
  extend various systems like blocks, field widgets, and image effects and add
  new options for administrators to choose from.

  Why plugins? Plugins are much like PHP native interfaces with a little extra:
  the plugin system can discover every implementation of an interface (the
  default is magic namespacing), deals with metadata (by default this is
  provided by annotations) and provides a factory for the plugin classes.
  Plugin, Tagged Service or Service? Plugins and tagged services Both plugins
  and tagged services implement different behaviors via a common interface. For
  example, think of image transformations (for example scale, crop, and
  desaturate).

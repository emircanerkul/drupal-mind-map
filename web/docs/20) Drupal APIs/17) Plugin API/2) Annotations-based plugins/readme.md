  and describe their metadata. Some of the plugin types provided by the core
  are: Blocks (see */src/Plugin/Block/* for many examples) Field formatters,
  Field widgets (see */src/Plugin/Field/* for many examples) All Views plugins
  (see */src/Plugin/views/* for many examples) Conditions (used for Block
  visibility in the core) Migrate source, process & destination plugins Please
  have a look at them in addition to this documentation to see real-life

Assertions are used to test the expectations of the programmer at run time regarding the code state. They openly state conditions that should be **impossible** when code and configuration are in an error free state. This context sets them apart from exceptions. When you read an assert() statement you are reading something the writer of that assert() believed impossible. If it's not then the code that follows will act in some buggy manner or fail outright, further the code that came before has to have a bug. By stopping the code flow at the assertion point the code following the assertion can be ruled out as the actual source of the problem even though that would be the point of failure were the assert() statement not there.

Another consideration is testing assertions can introduce considerable overhead. For example, cache tags must be strings to be valid and if they are not the cache will become corrupted. Cache tags are only introduced when module developers are creating new code - after tests are concluded and the module deployed such tests become redundant, and they can involve traversing arrays with thousands of elements with an "is\_string" statement.

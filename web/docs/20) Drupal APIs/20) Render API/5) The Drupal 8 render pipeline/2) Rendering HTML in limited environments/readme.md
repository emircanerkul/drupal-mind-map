For HTML pages to be rendered in limited environments, such as when you are installing or updating Drupal, or when you put it in maintenance mode, or when an error occurs, a simpler HTML page renderer is used for rendering these bare pages: [BareHtmlPageRenderer](https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/core%21lib%21Drupal%21Core%21Render%21BareHtmlPageRenderer.php/class/BareHtmlPageRenderer/8).

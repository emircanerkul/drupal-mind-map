  may be out of date Announce page updates aurally Many page updates are
  expressed visually through color changes and animations. In order to make page
  updates apparent in a non-visual way, Drupal provides the Drupal.announce
  JavaScript method. This method creates an aria-live element on the page. Text
  appended to this node is read by a screen-reading user agent. Drupal.announce
  accepts a string to be read by an audio UA. You can also set a second
  parameter: the priority.

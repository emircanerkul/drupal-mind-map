When you have changed your migration(s) and want to retest them sometimes you have to manually remove their configuration. Use `drush config:delete your-migration-file-name-without-extension`.

### config\_devel

Or let [config\_devel](https://www.drupal.org/project/config%5Fdevel) let do the config reloads for you.

  password hashing framework for use in PHP applications. Phpass has been
  integrated into the following systems: WordPress 2.5+ bbPress Vanilla PivotX
  2.1.0+ Textpattern 4.4.0+ concrete5 5.6.3+ phpBB3 Joomla starting with
  versions 2.5.18 and 3.2.1 The password hashes generated with Phpass look like
  this: $P$B4J4RkvSe3QowfF/v6oHionn8CyW.a. The $P$ is the so called hash type
  identifier which indicates that the hash is a portable Phpass hash. The string
  after that consists of salt and a hash.

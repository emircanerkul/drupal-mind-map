The examples on this page use the [embedded\_data](https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/core%21modules%21migrate%21src%21Plugin%21migrate%21source%21EmbeddedDataSource.php/class/EmbeddedDataSource) source plugin for the sake of simplicity so that this example can be copy-pasted as a working example. In the real world, you would most probably want to migrate the nodes using for example the [CSV source plugin](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/api/migrate-api/migrate-source-plugins/migrating-data-from-a-csv-source) or to write a simple [SQL source plugin](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/api/migrate-api/migrate-source-plugins/migrating-data-from-a-sql-source) to read the source data from another database.

Taxonomy terms are an example of a data structure where an entity can have a reference to a parent. When a term is being migrated, it is possible that its parent term has not yet been migrated. Migrate API addresses this 'chicken or the egg' dilemma by creating a stub term for the parent so that the child term can establish a reference to it. When the parent term is eventually being migrated, Migrate API updates the previously created stub with the actual content.

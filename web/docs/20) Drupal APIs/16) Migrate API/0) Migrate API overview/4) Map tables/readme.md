Once a migrated row is saved and the destination ID is known, Migrate API saves the source ID, destination ID and the row hash into a map table ([see Track Changes option](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/api/migrate-api/migrate-source-plugins/overview-of-migrate-source-plugins#track%5Fchanges)). The source ID and the hash in the map allow for tracking changes for continuous migrations. The map between source and destination ID also [allows for looking up values](https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/core%21modules%21migrate%21src%21Plugin%21migrate%21process%21MigrationLookup.php/class/MigrationLookup) during other migrations that are executed later.

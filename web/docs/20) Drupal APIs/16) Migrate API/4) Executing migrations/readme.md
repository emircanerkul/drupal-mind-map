  Importing migration YAML definitions The contributed Migrate Plus module
  allows migration plugins to be implemented as configuration entities, allowing
  them to flexibly be loaded, modified, and saved. Make sure that core Migrate
  and contributed Migrate Plus modules are enabled. Navigate to
  admin/config/development/configuration/single/import of your Drupal 8 site.
  Select 'Migration' as the configuration type. Paste your migration definition
  YAML to the configuration import form and click 'Import'.

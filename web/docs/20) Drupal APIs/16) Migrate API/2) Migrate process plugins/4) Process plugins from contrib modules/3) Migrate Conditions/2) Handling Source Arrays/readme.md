  All process plugins provided by Migrate Conditions are set to "handle
  multiples". If the source value is a scalar, then this doesn't have any
  effect. If the source value is an array, it means that the process plugin gets
  the array all at once. In most cases, this will be the most natural way to
  handle things. Migrate Conditions provides tools to handle a source array at
  more granular levels. All Elements You can use the all_elements condition to
  evaluate a condition on each individual element of the source array.

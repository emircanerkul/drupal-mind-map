The logical conditions ([and](https://www.drupal.org/docs/contributed-modules/migrate-conditions/migrate-conditions-condition-plugins/and-condition) and [or](https://www.drupal.org/docs/contributed-modules/migrate-conditions/migrate-conditions-condition-plugins/or-condition)) can also be configured to offer special handling of an input array. By default, the conditions being AND-ed or OR-ed are evaluated on the source array. However, if the iterate configuration key is set then each of the AND-ed or OR-ed conditions is evaluated only on the element in the source array with the same index/key as the condition. Please see examples for how the iterate property is used with [and](https://www.drupal.org/docs/contributed-modules/migrate-conditions/migrate-conditions-condition-plugins/and-condition#s-3set-a-boolean-if-the-source-is-large-and-in-charge) and [or](https://www.drupal.org/docs/contributed-modules/migrate-conditions/migrate-conditions-condition-plugins/or-condition#s-3set-a-boolean-if-the-source-is-large-and-in-charge).

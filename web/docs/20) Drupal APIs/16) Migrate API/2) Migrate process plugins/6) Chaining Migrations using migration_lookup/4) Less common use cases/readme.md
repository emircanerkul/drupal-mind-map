See [the official documentation page of MigrationLookup class](https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/core%21modules%21migrate%21src%21Plugin%21migrate%21process%21MigrationLookup.php/class/MigrationLookup) for less common use cases such as:

* Looking up the value from multiple previous migrations rather than just one
* Controlling the creation of "stub" entities when the previous value wasn't found

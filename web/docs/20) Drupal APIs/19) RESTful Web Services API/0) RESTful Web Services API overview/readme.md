  The RESTful Web Services API is new in Drupal 8. For each REST resource, you
  can specify the supported verbs, and for each verb, you can specify the
  serialization formats & authentication mechanisms. This page is documenting
  capabilities of the REST module's API, about how to configure REST resource
  plugins, as well as how to create your own. For information on how to actually
  consume the REST API from an application, see "1. Getting started: REST
  configuration & REST request fundamentals" — it is the first page of a
  complete how-to!

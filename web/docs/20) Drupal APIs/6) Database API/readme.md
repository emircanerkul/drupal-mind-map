  Drupal's database abstraction layer provides a unified database query API that
  can query different underlying databases. It is built upon PHP's PDO (PHP Data
  Objects) database API, and inherits much of its syntax and semantics. Besides
  providing a unified API for database queries, the database abstraction layer
  also provides a structured way to construct complex queries, and it protects
  the database by using good security practices.

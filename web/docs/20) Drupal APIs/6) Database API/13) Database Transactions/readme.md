  Overview of Transactions Sometimes, developers will want to have database
  writes that are dependent upon the results of other database writes. A Drupal
  example would be programmatically creating a Node with an entity reference to
  a Media item. The developer will create the Media entity, then create the Node
  entity and set the Media entity as a reference on the Node entity.

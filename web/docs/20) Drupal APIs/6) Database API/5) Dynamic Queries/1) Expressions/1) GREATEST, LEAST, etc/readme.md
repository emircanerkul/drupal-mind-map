_Expressions_ with `GREATEST` and `LEAST` work the same on the by core supported databases (MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL and SQLite) for normal values. Only when mixed with `NULL` values are the results different. MySQL and MariaDB have a different option how to handle `NULL` values than PostgreSQL. The Microsoft SQL-server only likes to handle 'real' values in combination with `GREATEST`.

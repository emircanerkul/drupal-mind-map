  Overview The Typed Data API was created to provide developers with a
  consistent way of interacting with data in different ways. Not only does the
  API allow you to interact with the actual data, it also provides means of
  fetching more information, or metadata, about the actual data. The Typed Data
  API is a low level, generic and reusable object oriented API that appears at
  multiple levels of the Drupal 8 architecture. Take for example, the
  EntityAdapter, which extends TypedData and acts as a wrapper for an Entity. Or
  FieldItemBase, which is an unwrapped extension of TypedData.

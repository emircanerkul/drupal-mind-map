  What you need to update You need to provide code that performs an update to
  stored data whenever your module makes a change to its data model. A data
  model change is any change that makes stored data on an existing site
  incompatible with that site's updated codebase. In Drupal 8, there are several

  entity and field changes Configurable fields can be created programmatically
  this way: /** * Add field foo to Bar vocabulary.

| Entities are typed classes with methods |                     |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Generic methods                         | $entity\-\>id()     |
| Entity _type_ specific methods          | $node\-\>getTitle() |

Both types are defined and documented in _interfaces_.

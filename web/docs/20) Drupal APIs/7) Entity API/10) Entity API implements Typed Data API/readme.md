  Understanding Drupal's data model First, before we dive into the Typed Data
  API itself, we must understand how Drupalâ€™s data model (Entity API) used to be
  perceived. This is important because this is where the Typed Data API is
  coming from, and the Entity API is one of the systems it was designed for. An
  entity is a complex piece of data - composed of other pieces of data, like
  fields with a list of items. A field item is also complex - composed of more
  pieces of data, like text value and input format.

Configuration entities use the Entity API in order to keep configuration in the database.

### Differences compared to Content Entity

1. Integrates with [CMI API](https://www.drupal.org/developing/api/8/configuration) for exportability.
2. Doesn't have fields but uses properties instead.
3. Schema file (Content Entity uses [hook\_schema()](https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/core%21lib%21Drupal%21Core%21Database%21database.api.php/function/hook%5Fschema/8))

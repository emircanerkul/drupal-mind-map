  Display modes Display modes (found at admin/structure/display-modes) exist to
  provide different presentations of Content Entities for either viewing or
  editing. The two types of display modes are "view modes" and "form modes."
  Both of these display mode types—view modes and form modes—are examples of
  "configuration entities." Here is an example of an exported view mode.

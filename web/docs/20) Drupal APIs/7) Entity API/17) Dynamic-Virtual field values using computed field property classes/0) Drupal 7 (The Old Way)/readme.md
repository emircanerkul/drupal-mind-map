In Drupal 7, adding computed properties to fields was achieved with [hook\_field\_load()](https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/modules!field!field.api.php/function/hook%5Ffield%5Fload/7). You can see this implemented in [text\_field\_load()](https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/modules%21field%21modules%21text%21text.module/function/text%5Ffield%5Fload/7) for the text field's format processing.

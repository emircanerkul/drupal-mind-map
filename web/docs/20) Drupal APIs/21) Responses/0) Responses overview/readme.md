  What? HTTP is all about requests and responses. Drupal represents the
  responses it sends as Response objects. Drupal’s responses are Symfony
  Response objects. Symfony’s documentation also applies to Drupal. Drupal
  core’s additions Symfony's Response objects are fully supported, but are
  insufficient to fully support the rich Drupal ecosystem: we need more
  structured metadata than the very simple Symfony Response objects can provide.
  Unfortunately, Symfony Response objects do not have an interface: every
  specialized Response "type" needs to extend from Symfony's Response base
  class.

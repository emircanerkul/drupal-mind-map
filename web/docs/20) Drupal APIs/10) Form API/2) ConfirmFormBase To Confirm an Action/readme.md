  Confirmation forms are fairly simple to build and are the recommended way to
  prompt a user for confirmation of an action. As with many forms, it all begins
  with a route. Routes Within a module's *.routing.yml file, create a route to
  the form. In many cases, it will be desirable to pass a parameter from the
  path to the confirmation form, as would be the case some kind of content was
  being deleted.

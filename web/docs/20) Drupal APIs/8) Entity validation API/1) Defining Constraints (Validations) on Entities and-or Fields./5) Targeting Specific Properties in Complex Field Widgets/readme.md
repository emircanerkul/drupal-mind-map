If you are working with fields/field widgets using multiple values or properties and you want to target a specific property or your constraint is validated and fails correctly, but the error message is not showing up on the form or the field marked is not the expected field, take a look at the _property path_ of your violation. For constraints validating fields, this is just the field name by default. You may need to extend that to target a specific delta or property in the widget. Use [ConstraintViolationBuilderInterface::atPath()](https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/vendor%21symfony%21validator%21Violation%21ConstraintViolationBuilderInterface.php/function/ConstraintViolationBuilderInterface%3A%3AatPath/8.2.x) to do that. Check out [ValidReferenceConstraintValidator::validate()](https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/core%21lib%21Drupal%21Core%21Entity%21Plugin%21Validation%21Constraint%21ValidReferenceConstraintValidator.php/function/ValidReferenceConstraintValidator%3A%3Avalidate/8.2.x) for an example.

Drupal uses the Symfony HTTP Kernel, a system which gets the request and asks other systems to produce the requested output (a response object) and sends the response back to the client. The output is generated by a piece of code called the controller. In theory the controller can be either a pure PHP 4 function, a method on an object or even an anonymous function. [See more about the Routing system](https://www.drupal.org/node/2046371)

The second part of creating a page that outputs our content is to put the **page controller** in place. This could be a PHP 4 style function, but best practice in Drupal is to use a controller class. This class is in a file named exactly after the controller provided in the routing file, `ExampleController.php`

[Drupal supports PSR-4](https://www.drupal.org/docs/develop/coding-standards/psr-4-namespaces-and-autoloading-in-drupal-8), which means that, for the above route the class needs to be placed in `example/src/Controller` directory and with name `ExampleController.php`. So the full path will look like, `example/src/Controller/ExampleController.php`.

**`ExampleController.php`**

```php
<?php

namespace Drupal\example\Controller;

use Drupal\Core\Controller\ControllerBase;

/**
 * An example controller.
 */
class ExampleController extends ControllerBase {

  /**
   * Returns a render-able array for a test page.
   */
  public function content() {
    $build = [
      '#markup' => $this->t('Hello World!'),
    ];
    return $build;
  }

}

```

With only the routing file and the page controller, we made a page available on our site at `/example` that outputs 'Hello World!' on a page titled 'Hello World'.

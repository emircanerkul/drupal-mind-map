You can use the `alterRoutes()` method to add dynamic routes as well. If your dynamic routes are standalone, the preferred method is not to implement this class and event subscriber but instead use [the simpler route\_callbacks solution](https://www.drupal.org/node/2122201). However, if the dynamic routes are dependent on other dynamic routes, you'll need to implement a class extending from [RouteSubscriberBase](https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/core%21lib%21Drupal%21Core%21Routing%21RouteSubscriberBase.php/class/RouteSubscriberBase/8). Make sure to adjust the weight of the event subscription in a [getSubscribedEvents()](https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/core%21modules%21config%5Ftranslation%21src%21Routing%21RouteSubscriber.php/function/RouteSubscriber%3A%3AgetSubscribedEvents/8) method implementation. A real example can be found in [the configuration translation RouteSubscriber](https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/core%21modules%21config%5Ftranslation%21src%21Routing%21RouteSubscriber.php/class/RouteSubscriber/8).

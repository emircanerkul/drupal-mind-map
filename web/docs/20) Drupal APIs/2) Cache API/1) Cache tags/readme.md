  Cache tags = data dependencies Cache tags describe dependencies on data
  managed by Drupal Why? Cache tags provide a declarative way to track which
  cache items depend on some data managed by Drupal. This is essential for a
  content management system/framework like Drupal because the same content can
  be reused in many ways. In other words: it is impossible to know ahead of time
  where some content is going to be used. In any of the places where the content
  is used, it may be cached. Which means the same content could be cached in
  dozens of places.

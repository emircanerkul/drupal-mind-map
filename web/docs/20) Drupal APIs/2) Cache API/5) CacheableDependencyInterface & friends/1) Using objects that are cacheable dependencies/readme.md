Rendering is the most common example of depending on an object that is a cacheable dependency. To simplify that, we have [RendererInterface::addCacheableDependency($build, $dependency)](https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/core%21lib%21Drupal%21Core%21Render%21RendererInterface.php/function/RendererInterface%3A%3AaddCacheableDependency/8) — where `$build` is the render array that depends on the object `$dependency`; the cacheability metadata of the object will automatically be "absorbed" by the render array. Which means the render array will be invalidated whenever the object's cache tag is invalidated, will cause a different version to be cached if a different translation is used (i.e. the content language cache context maps to a different language) and will expire automatically if the dependency has a max-age that isn't permanent (infinite).

See [Cacheability of render arrays — Concrete example](/developing/api/8/render/arrays/cacheability#concrete-example) for a full example.

Another good example is access checks, which return [AccessResult](https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/core%21lib%21Drupal%21Core%21Access%21AccessResult.php/class/AccessResult/8) objects, which also has an [AccessResult::addCacheableDependency($dependency)](https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/core%21lib%21Drupal%21Core%21Access%21AccessResult.php/function/AccessResult%3A%3AaddCacheableDependency/8) method. Note that here, we _only_ have the `$dependency` parameter, because we can store the cacheability metadata of the passed in dependency on the access result object itself. (The renderer, with its render arrays, is the exception.)

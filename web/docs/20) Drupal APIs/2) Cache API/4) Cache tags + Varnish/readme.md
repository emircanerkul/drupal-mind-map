[Varnish Cache](https://www.varnish-cache.org/) is a web application accelerator also known as a caching HTTP reverse proxy. Varnish is used on thousands of Drupal sites to speed up page load performance by a factor of 10-1000x, and it can be used with cache tags to make cache invalidation easy.

For basic cache tag integration, you need to do three things to make sure Varnish works well with the cache tags generated by Drupal:

1. [Update your Varnish VCL](#update-varnish-vcl) so it handles BAN requests properly
2. [Send a cache tags header](#send-cache-tags-header) (e.g. `X-Cache-Tags`) header with every request, containing a space-separated list of all the page's cache tags.
3. Send a BAN request with the appropriate cache tags whenever content or configuration is updated that should expire pages with the associated cache tags.

  Overview Blocks in Drupal 8 are actually made up of two separate API
  structures to create a user experience similar to what Drupal has maintained
  in past iterations. These two APIs are the Block Plugin API, which is a
  stand-alone reusable API, and the Block Entity API which is a Drupal
  8-specific use case of block placement and visibility control.

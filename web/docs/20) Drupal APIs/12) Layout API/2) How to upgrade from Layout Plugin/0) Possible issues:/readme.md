* [#2872957: Document that the 'css' property no longer works after upgrading from layout plugin](https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/issues/2872957 "Status: Active")
* Names changing for bundled layouts, e.g. "onecol" changes to "layout\_onecol"; this can be handled via an update script.
* API changes for custom integrations; this needs documentation.

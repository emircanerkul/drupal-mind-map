  Overview For non-developers there is a contributed module called Tour UI that
  can help with the creation of tours. The following documentation is a
  developer oriented approach. To manually create step by step tours in Drupal 8
  using the core Tour module, you will follow roughly these steps: adding a YAML
  document to your module's config/optional folder naming the file according to
  the pattern: module.type.id.yml write the yml file according to the structure:
  id - The ID of the tour module - The name of your module ("forum" in our
  case). langcode - The language of the tour.

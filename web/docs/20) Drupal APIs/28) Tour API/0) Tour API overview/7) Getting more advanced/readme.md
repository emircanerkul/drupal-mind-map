If you find you need to do something more advanced than show a text tip, for example, you need some additional parameters or logic, you will need to create a tip plugin by implementing the TipPluginInterface. See the tour\_test module for an example - it contains an image plugin that renders an image instead of text, taking a 'url' configuration key instead of a body.

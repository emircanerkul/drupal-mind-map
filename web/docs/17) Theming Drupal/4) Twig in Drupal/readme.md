  Twig is a template engine for PHP and it is part of the Symfony2 framework.
  Since Drupal 8 Twig replaces PHPTemplate as the default templating engine. One
  of the results of this change is that all of the theme_* functions and
  PHPTemplate based *.tpl.php files have been replaced by *.html.twig templating
  files. Early versions of Drupal 8 used Twig version 1.x, Drupal 8.7 introduce
  compatibility with with Twig 2.x. Some Twig features differ between these
  versions, so theme developers should avoid deprecated Twig features for
  future-compatible themes. Drupal 10 uses Twig 3.x.

[Twig](https://twig.symfony.com/doc/2.x/) is a template engine for PHP and it is part of the [Symfony2 framework](http://symfony.com/).

Since Drupal 8 [Twig replaces PHPTemplate as the default templating engine](/node/1831138). One of the results of this change is that all of the `theme_*` functions and PHPTemplate based `*.tpl.php` files have been replaced by `*.html.twig` templating files.

Early versions of Drupal 8 used [Twig version 1.x](https://twig.symfony.com/doc/1.x/), Drupal 8.7 introduce compatibility with with Twig 2.x. [Some Twig features differ between these versions](https://twig.symfony.com/doc/1.x/deprecated.html), so theme developers should avoid deprecated Twig features for future-compatible themes. Drupal 10 uses Twig 3.x.

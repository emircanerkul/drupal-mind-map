You can think of the suggestions as naming hints telling the system to pick and choose based on the right circumstances.

The template suggestions are set through theme suggestion hooks which can be altered. These hooks allow any module or theme to provide alternative theme functions or template name suggestions and reorder or remove suggestions provided by hook\_theme\_suggestions\_HOOK() or by earlier invocations of this hook.

### How Drupal determines page theme hook suggestions based on path

Here is another explanation based on the [theme\_get\_suggestions()](https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/core%21includes%21theme.inc/function/theme%5Fget%5Fsuggestions/8) function:

The list of possible templates for a given page is generated by Drupal through the [theme\_get\_suggestions()](https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/core%21includes%21theme.inc/function/theme%5Fget%5Fsuggestions/8) function, which is called by the [system\_theme\_suggestions\_page()](https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/core%21modules%21system%21system.module/function/system%5Ftheme%5Fsuggestions%5Fpage/8) function.

The [Drupal path](http://drupal.org/node/19828) of the page is first broken up into its components. As mentioned above, the Drupal path is not any of its aliases: there is one and only one Drupal path for a page. For the examples "<http://www.example.com/node/1/edit>" and "<http://www.example.com/mysitename?q=node/1/edit>", the Drupal path is node/1/edit, and its components are "node", 1, and "edit".

Next, the prefix is set to "page". Then, for every component, the following logic is followed:

1. If the component is a number, add the prefix plus "\_\_%" to the list of suggestions.
2. Regardless of whether the component is a number or not, add the prefix plus "\_\_" plus the component to the list of suggestions.
3. If the component is _not_ a number, append "\_\_" plus the component to the prefix.

After the list of components is iterated through, if the page is the front page (as set through _"Administration > Configuration > System > Site information."_), then "page\_\_front" is added to the list of suggestions.

Note that eventually, to turn a suggestion into an actual file name, "\_\_" gets turned into "--", and ".html.twig" gets appended to the suggestion. Thus, for node/1/edit, we get the following list of suggestions:

1. `page.html.twig` (this is always a suggestion)
2. `page--node.html.twig` (and prefix is set to page\_\_node)
3. `page--node--%.html.twig`
4. `page--node--1.html.twig` (prefix is not changed because the component is a number)
5. `page--node--edit.html.twig` (and prefix is set to page\_\_node\_\_edit)
6. `page--front.html.twig` (but only if node/1/edit is the front page)

When the page is actually rendered, the _last_ suggestion is checked. If it exists, that suggestion is used. Otherwise the next suggestion up is checked, and so on. Of course, if none of the overriding suggestions exist, page.html.twig is the final suggestion. This also explains why page--front.html.twig, if it exists, overrides any other suggestion for the front page: it is always the last suggestion for the page designated as the front page.

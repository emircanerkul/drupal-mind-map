  How Twig in Drupal normally works By default, the Twig theming engine compiles
  templates into PHP code and stores the compiled template code in the
  filesystem (by default these files will be in sites/default/files/php/twig).
  After Twig is finished with some markup, there's another layer of caching in
  the Render API.

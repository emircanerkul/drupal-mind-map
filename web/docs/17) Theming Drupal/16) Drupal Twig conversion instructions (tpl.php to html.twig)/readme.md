  in the Drupal core issue queue. Only use the Twig conversion sandbox to find
  previously converted templates and functions. Steps for Core contributors:

Note: All Twig work is now being done in the [Drupal core issue queue](https://drupal.org/project/issues/drupal?text=Twig&version=8.x). Only use the [Twig conversion sandbox](http://drupal.org/sandbox/pixelmord/1750250) to find previously converted templates and functions.

Steps for Core contributors:

* Find [core issues](https://drupal.org/node/1757550) to post and review patches.
* Do not apply patches to the sandbox
* Do not create patches for the sandbox.
* Only use the sandbox to test and/or retrieve previously converted code.

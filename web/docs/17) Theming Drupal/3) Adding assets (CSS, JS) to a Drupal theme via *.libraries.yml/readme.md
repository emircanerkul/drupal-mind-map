  This documentation is for themes. For modules, see Adding stylesheets (CSS)
  and JavaScript (JS) to a Drupal module. In Drupal, CSS stylesheets (CSS) and
  JavaScript (JS) are loaded through the same system for modules and themes as
  asset libraries. Drupal uses a high-level principle: assets (CSS or JS) are
  still only loaded if you tell Drupal it should load them. Drupal does not load
  all assets on every page because it slows down front-end performance.

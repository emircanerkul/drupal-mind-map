  Sub-themes are just like any other theme, with one difference: They inherit
  the parent theme's resources. There are no limits on the chaining capabilities
  connecting sub-themes to their parents. A sub-theme could be a child of
  another sub-theme, and it could be branched and organized however you see fit.
  This is what gives sub-themes great potential. See also Sub-theme inheritance
  properties. To create a sub-theme, define it like any other theme and declare
  its base theme with the "base theme" key.

[Sub-themes](/node/225125) are just like any other theme, with one difference: They inherit the parent theme's resources. There are no limits on the chaining capabilities connecting sub-themes to their parents. A sub-theme could be a child of another sub-theme, and it could be branched and organized however you see fit. This is what gives sub-themes great potential. See also [Sub-theme inheritance properties](https://www.drupal.org/docs/theming-drupal/sub-theme-inheritance).

To create a sub-theme, [define it like any other theme](/theme-guide/8/defining-a-theme) and declare its base theme with the ["base theme" key](/docs/8/theming-drupal-8/defining-a-theme-with-an-infoyml-file#base-theme). (Note that this key has no underscore.)

  Changes to core classes Simplified names of "element-x" helper classes Drupal
  7 introduced some new classes: element-hidden, element-invisible and
  element-focusable. It was difficult to understand exactly what these classes
  did from their names, so the class names were changed. The new names should
  make the classes easier to understand and are more consistent with HTML 5
  Boilerplate, a popular HTML 5 framework.

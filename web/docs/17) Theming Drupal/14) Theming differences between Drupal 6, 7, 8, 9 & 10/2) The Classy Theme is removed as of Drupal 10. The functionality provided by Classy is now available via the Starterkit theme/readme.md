The Classy theme was used as a base theme that provided templates with additional classes that made it easier to target specific elements with CSS. Themes that declare no base theme require building everything "from scatch". Themes using Classy as a base theme are provided with a reasonably neutral starting point so the actual styling of a theme can begin sooner.

The benefits of Classy are still available in Drupal 10, but they are now provided by the [Starterkit theme](https://www.drupal.org/docs/core-modules-and-themes/core-themes/starterkit-theme). Unlike Classy, themes do not declare Starterkit as a base theme. Instead, a theme is [generated](https://www.drupal.org/docs/core-modules-and-themes/core-themes/starterkit-theme#s-generating-a-new-theme) with Starterkit that includes the templates that were previously provided by Classy.

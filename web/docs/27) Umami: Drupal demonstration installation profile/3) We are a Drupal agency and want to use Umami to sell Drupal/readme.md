Yay! We wish you great success.

While Drupal core itself is very capable, it is natural that you may want to add certain contributed modules or customize the demo in other ways. Unfortunately, Drupal core does not support [inheritance in install profiles](https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/issues/1356276) yet. However, using that patch, you can build your derivative install profile which expands Umami and adds your desired elements. We are eager to see profiles expanding Umami contributed to drupal.org.

Thank you for installing Umami. We hope you like it!

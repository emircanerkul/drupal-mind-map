The Umami feature set will change and improve over time as new features are added to Drupal, and there is no promise of backward compatibility. Later Drupal versions may make changes that are still compatible with your existing install, but even then the latest content and configuration changes will not take effect until you reinstall. We may also make changes that break your current install, such as modify content types and theme code built around that or introduce dynamic editable layouts instead of hardcoding them in the theme. Changes like that will break your existing Drupal demo install.

Feel free to tinker around with the demo, create and modify views, edit fields, add pages. Nothing is locked down. Umami is a fully functioning demo of Drupal with several core features demonstrated, so you can explore by modifying bits and pieces.

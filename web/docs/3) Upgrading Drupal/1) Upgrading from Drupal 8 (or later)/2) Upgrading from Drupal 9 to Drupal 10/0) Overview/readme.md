  How to upgrade Confirm hosting environment Ensure your hosting environment
  matches the platform requirements of Drupal 10. Update to 9.4 or 9.5 Update to
  Drupal 9.4.x or 9.5.x (if not already on that version). If any modules or
  themes that have been removed you may use the respective contributed project
  instead. Update contributed projects Update all contributed projects and
  ensure they are Drupal 10 compatible. Make sure to update all contributed
  modules and themes and ensure they are all compatible with Drupal 10. They
  will also still be compatible with your Drupal 9.4+ site.

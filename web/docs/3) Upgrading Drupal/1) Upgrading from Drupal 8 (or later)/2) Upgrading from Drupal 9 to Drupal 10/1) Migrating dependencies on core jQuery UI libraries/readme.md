  jQuery UI libraries are no longer in core, but everything needed is in contrib
  jQuery UI libraries are no longer provided by Drupal core. If your
  modules/themes depend on a core jQuery UI library (i.e. depend on any library
  that begins with core/jquery.ui), they must be updated to depend on libraries
  provided by contrib modules instead. These contrib modules work with Drupal
  9.2 and newer in addition to Drupal 10, so you can make this switch on an
  existing Drupal 9 site.

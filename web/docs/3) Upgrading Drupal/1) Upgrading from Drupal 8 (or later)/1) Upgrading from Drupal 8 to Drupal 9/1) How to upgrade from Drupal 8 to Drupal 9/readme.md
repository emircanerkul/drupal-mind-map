  This page provides instructions on how to upgrade from Drupal 8 to Drupal 9.
  For upgrading from prior versions of Drupal (such as Drupal 6 and 7), see
  Upgrading from Drupal 6 or 7 to Drupal 8. There are separate instructions for
  minor and patch version site updates. (For example, updating from Drupal 9.3.6
  to 9.3.8, or 9.2.14 to 9.3.8.) Prerequisites Your site must be updated to the
  latest minor version. Upgrades are only supported from the final scheduled
  minor release and one previous (e.g. Drupal 8.8 and 8.9), not from earlier
  releases (e.g. Drupal 8.3). Follow the update instructions.

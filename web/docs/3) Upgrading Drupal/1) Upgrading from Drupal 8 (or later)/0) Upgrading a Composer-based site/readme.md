  How to upgrade Perform the following steps from your Drupal site's root (where
  composer.json lives). The examples show the instructions for updating from
  Drupal 9.5.0 to Drupal 10.0.0. You must change the version numbers according
  to your needs. Temporarily add write access to protected files and
  directories: chmod 777 web/sites/default chmod 666
  web/sites/default/*settings.php chmod 666 web/sites/default/*services.yml Get
  both the core-recommended and dev-dependencies packages as dependencies.

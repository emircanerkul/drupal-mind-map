  There are various tools to ensure Drupal 9 compatibility of a project. This
  section is about the process to follow. Keep supported core branches in mind
  Drupal core has a year of support for core branches. For example, when Drupal
  8.8.0 was released, Drupal 8.6.0 became unsupported and support for 8.7.0
  continued. Support for Drupal 8.7.0 will only end once 8.9.0 is released on
  June 3, 2020. This means that even though the tools may be reporting that
  something is deprecated, it may not be actionable because it would mean
  dropping support for an otherwise supported core branch.

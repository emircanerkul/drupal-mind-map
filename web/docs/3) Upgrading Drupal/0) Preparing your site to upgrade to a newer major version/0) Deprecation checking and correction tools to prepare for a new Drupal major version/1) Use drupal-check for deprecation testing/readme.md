[Matt Glaman built drupal-check](https://github.com/mglaman/drupal-check) (only for Drupal 8), which allows you to run a standalone PHP executable from the command line and get a report of any deprecated code used. This can be integrated in build processes and continuous integration systems. This helps ensure Drupal 9 compatibility of your custom code, contributed modules, and Drupal 7 to 8 migration code.

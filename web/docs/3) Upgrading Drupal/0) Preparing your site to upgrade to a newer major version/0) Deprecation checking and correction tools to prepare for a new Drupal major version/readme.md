  Use an IDE or code editor that understands deprecations If you are developing
  Drupal code, it is best to use an IDE or code editor that understands
  deprecations (@deprecated annotations particularly). For example, IDEs like
  PHPStorm will cross out calls to deprecated methods and inform you of what
  should be used instead. Deprecated code use will be made visible as part of
  the development process.

  Drupal 8 (or later) core 'Migrate Drupal' module provides API support for
  Drupal-to-Drupal migrations, and 'Migrate Drupal UI' offers a simple user
  interface to upgrade from older Drupal versions. Report results of your
  upgrade When you are upgrading your Drupal 6 or Drupal 7 site to Drupal 8 (or
  later) make sure to test and verify your results thoroughly. It is possible
  that you will find something which did not upgrade as you expected.

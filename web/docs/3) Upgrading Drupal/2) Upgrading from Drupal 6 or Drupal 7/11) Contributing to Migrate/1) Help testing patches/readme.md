If you want to help testing the migration patches, youâ€™ll need to set up a test environment. Always apply the patches against the latest Drupal 8 (or later) dev version.

* For information on using git to apply patches, please see the [git patch contributor guide](http://drupal.org/node/1054616).
* For more generic information about patches, please see the [Patch section](http://drupal.org/patch) of the Getting Involved Guide.

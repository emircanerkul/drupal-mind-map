The _Pre-upgrade analysis_ summary is the final page before the actual execution of the upgrade, so this is the final chance to hit **Cancel**. Once you press the **Perform upgrade** button, the process is started.

New messages show up at the top of the page, while old ones disappear at the bottom as the process goes on.

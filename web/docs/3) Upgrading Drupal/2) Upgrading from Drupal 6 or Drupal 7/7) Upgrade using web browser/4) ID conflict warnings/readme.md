As described in the [Preparing an upgrade page](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/upgrade/preparing-a-site-for-upgrade-to-drupal-8#dont%5Fcreate%5Fcontent), upgrading from Drupal 6 or Drupal 7 to Drupal 9 or higher should be done to an complete empty new Drupal site. For example, if you manually create a node to the new Drupal site before upgrading and the source Drupal 6 / 7 site has a node with the same ID, the migration system will overwrite the node that was manually created in new Drupal site.

If conflicting IDs are detected, a warning about conflicting IDs will be shown as illustrated below. You can either ignore this warning and risk losing data or abort and take an alternative approach as described in the [Known Issues documentation](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/upgrade/known-issues-when-upgrading-from-drupal-6-or-7-to-drupal-8#id%5Fconflicts).

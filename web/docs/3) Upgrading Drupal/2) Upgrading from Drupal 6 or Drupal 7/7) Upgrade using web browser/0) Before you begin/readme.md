Before you begin the upgrade, make sure you have read the previous pages of this handbook:

* [Preparing an upgrade](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/upgrade/preparing-an-upgrade)
* [Choosing the upgrade approach](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/upgrade/choosing-the-upgrade-approach)

Make sure you are using the [latest version of Drupal 9 or higher](http://www.drupal.org/project/drupal). You can check your version at the status report page of your Drupal site (/admin/reports/status).

Make sure the following core modules are enabled on your new Drupal site:

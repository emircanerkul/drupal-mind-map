If you use Acquia Dev Desktop and have your Drupal 6 site in Dev Desktop, the default database credentials are `drupaluser` with an empty password and the 33067 port for the database on the 127.0.0.1 IP address. Altogether that leads to `--legacy-db-url=mysql://drupaluser:@127.0.0.1:33067/drupal_6` the commands assuming the database name is `drupal_6`. Run `drush status` if you are having trouble connecting in order to verify these values.

  Drush is a command line shell and scripting interface for Drupal. Upgrading to
  Drupal 9 or higher using Drush is an alternative to using the browser user
  interface. Upgrading using Drush is very useful when migrating complex sites
  as it allows you to run migrations one by one and it allows rollbacks.
  Installing Drush with Composer Drupal 8 or higher sites can be built using
  Composer.

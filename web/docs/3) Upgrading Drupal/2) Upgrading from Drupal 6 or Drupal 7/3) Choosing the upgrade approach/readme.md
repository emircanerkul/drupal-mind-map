  # Overview When preparing an upgrade, it is worth spending a while to plan the
  upgrade approach. While the content of your previous Drupal site can most
  probably be migrated without issues, the configuration of your new Drupal site
  will most probably need some manual tasks. For example, Views module doesnâ€™t
  have an automatic upgrade path in core which means you will need to manually
  create the views on your new Drupal site. The most suitable approach needs to
  be considered for each site.

When preparing an upgrade, it is worth spending a while to plan the upgrade approach. While the _content_ of your previous Drupal site can most probably be migrated without issues, the _configuration_ of your new Drupal site will most probably need some manual tasks. For example, Views module doesnâ€™t have an automatic upgrade path in core which means you will need to manually create the views on your new Drupal site. The most suitable approach needs to be considered for each site.

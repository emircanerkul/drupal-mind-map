The upgrade process expects you to first update your old site to the latest minor version. If your site is for example running Drupal core 6.35, you need to first update to 6.38.

If you're planning to automatically migrate configuration or content from contributed modules, you are expected to be using the latest versions of them. 

Use the Available Updates page of your Drupal 6 / 7 site at at admin/reports/updates to see if there are updates available.

Keep in mind that the upgrade process will overwrite configuration on the Drupal destination site, so **do not do any configuration of the Drupal site until after the upgrade process is complete**. This means you do not have to create all the content types and fields manually before running this upgrade. The Migrate module will create them as a part of the migration process. In fact, it is a common best practice to install using the Minimal install profile, because the Standard profile introduces its own configuration that you might not want to use. This is different than the way Migrate worked in Drupal 7 and earlier, where you had to have all the content types and fields prepared and ready before running Migrate.

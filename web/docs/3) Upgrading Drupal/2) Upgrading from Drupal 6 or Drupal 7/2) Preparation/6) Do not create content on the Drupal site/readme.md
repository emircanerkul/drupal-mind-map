The upgrade process maintains the unique identifiers from the source site. For example, if a user account had the unique ID 2 on the source site (thus was at the relative URI /user/2), after upgrade the same user account will be at /user/2 on the new site. If you were to create a user account on the new site beyond the default administrator account, it would be assigned user ID 2 - then, when running the upgrade process, the account from the source site with user ID 2 would overwrite it. This applies to user accounts, taxonomy terms, and node content, as well as pretty much any other kind of content with numeric IDs from your source site.

To avoid data loss, do not manually create anything on the Drupal site until all your source content has been fully imported.

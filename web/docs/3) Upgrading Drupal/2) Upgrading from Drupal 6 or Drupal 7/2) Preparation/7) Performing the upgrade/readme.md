You have two choices to actually execute the migration:

1. [Using the browser user interface](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/upgrade/upgrade-using-the-user-interface). This is the easier method and it can be done through the user interface. However, it offers less control over the migration.
2. [Using Drush](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/upgrade/upgrade-using-drush). This is more robust and faster and allows selective migration but it requires additional modules and it must be run from the command line.

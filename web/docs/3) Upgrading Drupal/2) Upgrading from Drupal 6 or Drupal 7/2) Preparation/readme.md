  Prior to upgrading it is recommended that you take a few steps to ensure the
  process will be smooth and have the desired results. When upgrading from
  Drupal 6 or Drupal 7 configuration and content entities are migrated from the
  source site to a clean Drupal site. Refer to the Upgrading from Drupal 6 or 7
  page for an overview of the process and key differences. Even though the
  upgrade does not modify the source site in any way, it's recommended that it
  is not performed on a live site.

Prior to upgrading it is recommended that you take a few steps to ensure the process will be smooth and have the desired results.

When upgrading from Drupal 6 or Drupal 7 _configuration_ and _content_ entities are _migrated_ from the source site to a clean Drupal site. Refer to the [Upgrading from Drupal 6 or 7](https://www.drupal.org/docs/upgrading-drupal/upgrading-from-drupal-6-or-drupal-7) page for an overview of the process and key differences.

Even though the upgrade does not modify the source site in any way, it's recommended that it is not performed on a live site. It's a good idea to use a backup of your live site to ensure a consistent database state (no writes to the database while the migration is running), and to prevent any performance impact on the live site.

Let’s say that you have _content type A_ in your Drupal 7 site with fields _foo_, _bar,_ and _baz_. Let’s also say that you want to rename the field _baz_ to _zot_. These kinds of changes are quite simple to do when you are [migrating using drush](https://www.drupal.org/node/2350651). 

* Create the migrations using `drush migrate:upgrade --configure-only` as instructed on the page linked above.
* Run the node type and field migrations. This will generate _content type A_ and fields _foo_, _bar,_ and _baz_.
* Manually create field _zot_ on the destination site. Delete the field _baz_ that the migrations created but which you are not planning to use.
* The contributed [Migrate Plus](https://www.drupal.org/project/migrate%5Fplus) module allows migration plugins to be implemented as configuration entities, allowing them to flexibly be loaded, modified, and saved. The individual migrations generated with `drush migrate:upgrade --configure-only` can now be inspected by navigating to admin/config/development/configuration/single/export and by selecting 'Migration' as the Configuration type. Select the migration for _Nodes (A)_.
* Copy-paste the migration to admin/config/development/configuration/single/import but change the field mapping so that the destination field will be _field\_zot_ but you still map the source from _field\_baz_. The exact content of the migration definition will depend on the field type. To understand the anatomy of the migrations, please refer to the [examples provided in the Migrate API documentation](https://www.drupal.org/node/2917492).
* Once you have imported the modified migration, you can run the migration for A nodes with Drush and verify that the data was migrated to field _zot_ correctly.
* Repeat the mapping change for Node revisions (A) migration if you're planning to also migrate node revisions.

Another way to achieve the same result is to manually create the new field _zot_ as described above and alter the field mapping of _Nodes (A)_ migration by implementing [hook\_migration\_plugins\_alter()](#s-hook-migration-plugins-alter).

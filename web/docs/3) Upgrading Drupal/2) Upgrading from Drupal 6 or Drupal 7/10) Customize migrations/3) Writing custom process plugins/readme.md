If you need to define custom transformation logic (if this, then that) you might want to consider writing a custom process plugin. 

The [example in Migrate API documentation](https://www.drupal.org/node/2917492) uses User migration as an example. The userâ€™s language code determination needs if-else logic as described in the example and therefore the User module provides its own process plugin UserLangocode. 

The example linked above describes how the process should be saved to the MODULE/src/Plugin/migrate/process directory and how it should be annotated so that it can be used. Use the [UserLangcode ](https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/core%21modules%21user%21src%21Plugin%21migrate%21process%21UserLangcode.php/class/UserLangcode/8.4.x)and other process plugins as examples when writing your own!

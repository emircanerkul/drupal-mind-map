If you prefer to write your custom responses to the core prepare\_row hook in an object-oriented way instead of implementing the hook\_migrate\_prepare\_row(), you can do this if you have the contributed [Migrate Plus](https://www.drupal.org/project/migrate%5Fplus) module enabled. Migrate Plus provides a PREPARE\_ROW event which your event subscriber can register to. Drupal API documentation for [Events](https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/core%21core.api.php/group/events/8.4.x). For an example of event subscriber implementation in another context, you can refer to this [example from the Simple FB Connect module handbook](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/modules/simple-fb-connect/eventsubscriber-example).

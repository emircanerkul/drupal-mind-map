The contributed [i18n ](http://www.drupal.org/project/i18n)module has a Menu translation sub-module which provides the Drupal 6 capability to

* Define language to menu items
* Translate the menu items using the string translation user interface.

Similar capabilities are in Drupal 8+ core. Migrating the menu item languages and their translations from Drupal 6 is supported.

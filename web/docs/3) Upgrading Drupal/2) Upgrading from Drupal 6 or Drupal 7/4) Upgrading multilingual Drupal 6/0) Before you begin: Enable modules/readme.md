Drupal has an extensive multilingual support in Core. As explained in the [Drupal Multilingual Guide](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/multilingual/choosing-and-installing-multilingual-modules), the multilingual capabilities are provided by the following core modules:

* Language
* Interface Translation
* Content Translation
* Configuration Translation.

Make sure that you have all these core modules enabled on your new Drupal site before running upgrade.

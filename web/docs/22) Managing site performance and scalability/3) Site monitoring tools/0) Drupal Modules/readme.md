  The following modules are helping with monitoring the health and status of one
  or multiple Drupal sites. For more information on how to set-up a specific
  module please look at the documentation of the module itself. The downside of
  using modules is the fact you'll need to install the module on every single
  site in order for you to be able to get the information. Luckily there are
  some other ways to achieve the same result without the need of installing a
  module for this.

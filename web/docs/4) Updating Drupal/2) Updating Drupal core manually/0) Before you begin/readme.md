> WARNING: The recommended update method is via Composer.
And, if you have installed any contributed modules with 3rd party dependencies using Composer, you need to use Composer to update Drupal core too, as the instructions below will overwrite your vendor/ directory.

If not already done, it is suggested that you read this [introduction](/docs/updating-drupal/overview-of-options), which summarizes your options to choose from when updating your Drupal. As mentioned, the recommended update method is via Composer.

PS! This update procedure is also described in [the User Guide](https://www.drupal.org/docs/user%5Fguide/en/security-update-core.html).

Note that drupal-x.y.z refers to Drupal and the version number, eg drupal-9.3.0.

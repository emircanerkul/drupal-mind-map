For convenience we included the [Drush](http://www.drush.org/) commands necessary to complete an update, many people find Drush quicker and easier than the web-based admin area.

You can either use drush:

```php
drush updatedb
drush cache:rebuild
```

Or you can visit `[YOUR DOMAIN]/update.php` in a browser.

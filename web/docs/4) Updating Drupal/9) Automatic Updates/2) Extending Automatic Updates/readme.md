Automatic Updates provides [an event-based API](https://git.drupalcode.org/project/automatic%5Fupdates/-/raw/8.x-2.x/package%5Fmanager/package%5Fmanager.api.php) that allows developers to hook into nearly every part of the update process. The API can be used to check for errors and stop the update from proceeding, or even starting in the first place, all without affecting your live Drupal site. It can also be used to implement custom triggers at each successful stage of the update process.

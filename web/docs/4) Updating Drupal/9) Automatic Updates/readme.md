  Updating a Drupal site is difficult, time-consuming, and expensive. It may
  appear easy its face, but ensuring secure and reliable updates that give
  assurance to site owners and availability to site visitors is a tricky
  problem. The Automatic Updates service for Drupal aims to simplify this
  process and provide confidence that an update will apply cleanly. Please note
  that Automatic Updates is a Strategic Initiative for the Drupal Project. The
  Initiative is still in progress, so there are some important elements to take
  note of: The Automatic Updates module is not yet in core.

> WARNING: Please note that Automatic Updates is a Strategic Initiative for the Drupal Project. The Initiative is still in progress, so there are some important elements to take note of:


The Automatic Updates module is not yet in core. An initial prototype is available as a contributed module at:&nbsp;https://drupal.org/project/automatic_updates; however, the core solution will be different from this module (building on parts of it, but not reusing the whole thing).


In this first phase, the Automatic Updates module included&nbsp;the Public Service Announcement&nbsp;but this functionality has been by added to Drupal core see&nbsp;Responding to critical security update advisories


The module only supports Composer based&nbsp;installations.

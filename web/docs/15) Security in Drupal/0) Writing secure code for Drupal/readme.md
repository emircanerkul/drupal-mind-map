  Know about a security issue? Please report the issue appropriately. Whether
  you are writing a PHP snippet or an entire module, it is important to keep
  your code secure. Sanitizing on output to avoid Cross Site Scripting (XSS)
  attacks Use Twig templates The Twig theme engine now auto escapes everything
  by default. That means, every string printed from a Twig template (e.g.
  anything between {{ }}) gets automatically sanitized if no filters are used.
  See Filters - Modifying Variables In Twig Templates for the Twig filters
  available in Drupal.

  The US National Institute of Standards and Technology issues and periodically
  updates standards documents related to security practices. A new revision of
  NIST Special Publication 800-63, released in June 2017, reflects changes in
  recommendations related to authentication using passwords, known as "memorized
  secrets" (see 800-63B, especially sec. 5.1.1). Since the majority of Drupal
  websites use such authentication methods, and since NIST guidelines are widely
  seen to reflect industry standards, this comparison may be relevant to
  individuals and organizations evaluating Drupal.

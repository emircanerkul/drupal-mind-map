Another method that is described in settings.php, for use with hash\_salt, is to place the value in a file outside of the document root and retrieve it in your settings.php. This approach can also be used for other values in modules, etc.

`$settings['hash_salt'] = file_get_contents('/home/example/salt.txt');`

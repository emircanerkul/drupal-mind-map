  Core CSS classes Names of "element-x" helper classes Drupal 7 introduced some
  new classes: element-hidden, element-invisible and element-focusable. It was
  difficult to understand exactly what these classes did from their names, so
  the class names were changed. The new names should make the classes easier to
  understand and are more consistent with HTML 5 Boilerplate, a popular HTML 5
  framework.

### Development environment

In order to start your Drupal 8 module upgrade, first **set up your development environment**. You will need a local web stack (MAMP, LAMP, etc.), git, and a code editor or IDE. See [Setting up a test environment](https://drupal.org/dev-env) for more information.

### Install a Drupal 8 stable release

Next, install a copy of Drupal 8 to use for testing. We recommend using the **most recent stable release** of Drupal 8 to work on contributed modules (rather than the nightly development build or git repository.) You can find the latest Drupal 8 stable release on the listing of [releases for Drupal 8 core](https://drupal.org/node/3060/release?api%5Fversion[]=7234).

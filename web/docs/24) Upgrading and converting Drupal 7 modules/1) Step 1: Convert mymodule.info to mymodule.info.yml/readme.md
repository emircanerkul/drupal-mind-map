  Before we begin replacing any code, we need to convert the module's .info file
  to a YAML file so Drupal 8 will recognize it. The easiest way to do this is by
  appending .yml to your .info file and converting the .info syntax to YAML
  syntax. The change record provides a comprehensive overview for how to do
  this. Once you've converted your .info file we'll check the extensions page in
  your website to make sure Drupal 8 successfully recognizes your module. 1.
  Rename your .info file D7: mymodule.info D8: mymodule.info.yml 2.

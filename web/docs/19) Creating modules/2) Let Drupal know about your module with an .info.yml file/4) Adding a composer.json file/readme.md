In addition to declaring dependencies on other modules in the `.info.yml` file, if a contributed module on Drupal.org wishes to test changes to module dependencies using DrupalCI as part of development, they must have a [composer.json](/docs/8/creating-custom-modules/add-a-composerjson-file) that expresses those Drupal module dependencies (DrupalCI can only detect changes to dependencies in patches within `composer.json`, not in `.info` or `.info.yml` files).

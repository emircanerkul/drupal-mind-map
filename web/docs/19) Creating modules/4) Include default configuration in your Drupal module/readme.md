  Main topic described: default configuration Overview In Drupal 8 and later,
  configuration are stored with the configuration system in plain text YAML
  files. For example the configuration management system takes care of creating
  and managing content types. You can ship a content type with your module by
  creating a properly named and structured configuration file. Example Create a
  file named node.type.example_mytype.yml and place it in your module's
  directory in a subdirectory called config/install.

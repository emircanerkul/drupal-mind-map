The [Drupal Console](https://drupalconsole.com/) utility provides the following command:

* [config:export:content:type](https://hechoendrupal.gitbooks.io/drupal-console/content/en/commands/config-export-content-type.html)

It will perform the following tasks:

* Export all configuration files associated with the specified content type (including its field configuration files).
* Place it in the desired module's configuration directory.

So it saves a lot of work required by the manual process above.

  Part II of A practical guide to building basic Drupal 8 modules From .info to
  tests, just the basics loremipsum.info.yml name: Lorem ipsum type: module
  description: 'Lorem ipsum generator for Drupal' package: Development
  core_version_requirement: ^8 || ^9 configure: loremipsum.form Info files are
  now formatted as YML, and there's a difference between modules and themes that
  must be made clear via the type declaration. The config declaration points to

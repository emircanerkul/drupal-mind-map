  From .info to tests, just the basics Intro Much has been said - and argued -
  about Drupal 8 and later, and one thing's for sure: module building has
  changed a great deal. There's plenty of tutorials covering the new ground, and
  in every one of them, authors advise developers to look out for even more
  modifications as the code matures. Over the last few days, I've investigated
  some of those tutorials, as well as the Examples module and have come up with
  a pretty neat example - one that I hope remains current in the near future!

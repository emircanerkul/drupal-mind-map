Having a `composer.json` file is not required for Drupal 9 compatibility. A [Drupal 9 compatible info.yml file](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/creating-custom-modules/let-drupal-8-know-about-your-module-with-an-infoyml-file#s-specifying-core-version-requirement) is required and is enough. If your project does have a `composer.json` file, having a `drupal/core` version requirement is also not required for Drupal 9 compatibility. **It is better not to provide** a `drupal/core` version requirement in `composer.json` because [Drupal's composer facade](https://www.drupal.org/project/project%5Fcomposer) will generate the appropriate metadata based on the info.yml file. If for some reason you do need to have a `drupal/core` version requirement in your `composer.json` file's `require` section, then it needs to be Drupal 9 compatible.

  In the following pages and sub-sections of the guide, we will be building
  using a custom module to build basic parts of a Drupal site, such as a custom
  page, block, entity, field, etc. All the module examples start with a module
  folder and a .info.yml file. With just these two things, your module will
  display in Drupal 8's Extend administration page, or can be installed directly
  using drush. The following pages will guide you in creating the .info.yml,
  which will become the starting point for every new module you create.

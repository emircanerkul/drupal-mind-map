If you would like to clone the git repository of the example code contained in this section, you must have git installed [and follow the Hello World module instructions](https://www.drupal.org/project/2466449/git-instructions). You can clone the git repository using the following command:

`git clone https://github.com/sidharrell/D8HWexample.git modules/custom/hello_world `

All of the files are downloaded by default but you can 'hide' them by checking out the 'skeleton' version to start with. To check it out, navigate to the module directory and use the following command:

`git checkout skeleton`

The rest of the branches should line up with the following sub-sections of this guide, and are designed to dovetail into their fuller counterparts in the [Examples For Developers](https://www.drupal.org/project/examples) module.

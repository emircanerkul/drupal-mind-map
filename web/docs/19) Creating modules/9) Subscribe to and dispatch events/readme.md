  Event Systems Overview Event systems are used in many complex applications as
  a way to allow extensions to modify how the system works. An event system can
  be implemented in a variety of ways, but generally the concepts and components
  that make up the system are the same. Event Subscribers - Sometimes called
  "Listeners", are callable methods or functions that react to an event being
  propagated throughout the Event Registry. Event Registry - Where event
  subscribers are collected and sorted. Event Dispatcher - The mechanism in
  which an event is triggered, or "dispatched", throughout the system.

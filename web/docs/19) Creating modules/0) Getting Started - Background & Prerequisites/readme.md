  Drupal leverages a number of advanced PHP language features and sophisticated
  3rd party libraries in order to present external developers with the most
  advanced API of any CMS available. While experienced Drupal 7 developers may
  see some significant changes, much of the basic structure will remain
  familiar. If any of the material presented while going through the D8 module
  developer's walk-through is new to you, then the material below may help.
  However, a comprehensive knowledge is not necessary to proceed to the D8
  module walkthrough.

By the way, when you have a live Drupal site, you will at times have a total of three Drupal sites running on your computer or web host.

**'Dev site':** Before making your website live on the internet, you will want to build a 'development' test version of your site. The test version could be on your own computer, or it could be online on your web hosting company's server.

**'Live site':** After you make your site live, you will want to create another 'development' site to test any new features you add. In the event that changes you make cause your site problems, you do not want those problems on your public site.

**'Working backup site':** Lastly, before you do make changes to your live site, you will want to grab a copy of your Drupal codebase, and your Drupal database, and use them to create a backup site to make sure you have what you need to recreate your live site as it is in the event that your changes to your live site go horribly wrong, for whatever reason.

You can, of course, delete the 'backup' installation after you establish that your backup codebase and database are 'good', but be sure to keep at least three separate sets of that codebase/database set, in three separate locations.

Three separate locations mean separate online companies or separate USB drives/hard drives in separate locations. This will prepare for a disaster: for example, a fire at your home/place of business, or one of your online storage facilities getting hacked into.

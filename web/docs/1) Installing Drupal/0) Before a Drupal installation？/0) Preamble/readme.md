Documentation for Drupal on drupal.org is found in two separate areas.

* This "Before installation" page is part of the 'open' Drupal community documentation section [Drupal documentation](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8).
* Additionally, similar material is also covered in the 'closed' Drupal community documentation [Drupal User Guide](https://www.drupal.org/docs/user%5Fguide/en/index.html) starting on page [3.1\. Concept: Server Requirements](https://www.drupal.org/docs/user%5Fguide/en/install-requirements.html) of [Chapter 3\. Installation](https://www.drupal.org/docs/user%5Fguide/en/installation-chapter.html).

The basic differences between the two documentation areas are discussed [here ⎘ ](https://www.drupal.org/node/2891711 "   This link opens in a new tab/window. "). (Link opens in a new tab/window.)

  Simplified in Drupal 8.8.0 Please note: If you started your project using
  Drupal version 8.8.0 or later, your site already uses the correct file
  structure and is ready to be converted to Composer. This page is a step by
  step guide to manually adding Composer support to an existing site that was
  previously installed without Composer. This howto is for you if you installed
  a Drupal site manually from a tarball or have used an abandoned Composer
  template like drupal/drupal. For sites created on Drupal 8.8.0 or later Even
  if you installed Drupal 8.8.0 from the tarball, Composer was pre-installed.

  Protecting against HTTP HOST Header attacks Protecting in Drupal 8 and later
  Drupal 8+ (i.e. currently Drupal 8, 9 and 10) can be configured to use the
  Symfony trusted host mechanism to prevent HTTP Host header spoofing. To enable
  the trusted host mechanism, you enable your allowable hosts in
  $settings['trusted_host_patterns'] in settings.php (i.e.
  sites/default/settings.php below the webroot). This should be an array of
  regular expression patterns, without delimiters, representing the hosts you
  would like to allow.

  covers server requirements, additional tools, preparing for installation, and
  running the installation script. Chapter 4 covers the next steps that should
  be done after the installation script has been completed. This guide covers
  much of the same material. These pages cover more options than the User Guide,

  other developer guides, we link to them rather than repeat it here.

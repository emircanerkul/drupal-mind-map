  Introduction This document is intended to outline a basic process of using Git
  in the context of a basic site building, testing and deployment process. While
  there are many possible approaches to fitting Git into this process, this
  particular set of procedures should work in most circumstances and contains
  many best practices for using Git in this manner. When applied properly and
  with some forethought, Git is a very powerful tool for helping to manage
  collaboration, configuration and code changes during the life cycle of a
  Drupal-based project.

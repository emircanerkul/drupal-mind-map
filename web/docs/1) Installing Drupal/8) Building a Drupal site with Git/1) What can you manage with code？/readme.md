One challenge of using any kind of change management with Drupal is that many configuration changes normally reside only in the project’s database. You can move some of these configuration settings into code using certain Drupal modules, such as [Ctools](/project/ctools) exportables, the [Features module](/project/features) or the [Configuration Management](/project/configuration) module. You may want to take advantage of these tools to export as much of your site’s configuration as possible into your repository for deployment and collaboration purposes. Additionally, the [Backup and Migrate](/project/backup%5Fmigrate) module can save database exports as files within your Drupal file tree; these are managed with Git like any other file.

Fortunately, since a Drupal site's module and theme files already live in code, you can manage those in Git without any extra tools.

Cron is a daemon that executes commands at specified intervals. These commands are called "cron jobs". Cron is available on Unix, Linux, and Mac servers. Windows servers use a [Scheduled Task](https://drupal.org/node/31506 "Configuring cron jobs with Windows | Drupal 7 guide on Drupal.org") to execute commands. The actual "cron job" is a time-triggered action that is usually (and most efficiently) performed by your website's hosting server, but can also be configured by a remote server or even from your own desktop.

What actually happens is that the cron job visits the cron.php file in your website at a URL like `http://www.example.com/cron.php?cron_key=0MgWtfB33FYbbQ5UAC3L0LL3RC0PT3RNUBZILLA0Nf1Re`. You can find the exact address of the cron.php file in the Status report at Administration > Reports > Status report (admin/reports/status) in the section Cron maintenance tasks.

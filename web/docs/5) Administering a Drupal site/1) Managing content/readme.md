  Adding content This guide assumes that you have used the standard profile when
  installing, which defines the two content types Basic Page and Article. (If
  you used the minimal profile, you need to define content types first.) Before
  we begin: Make sure you are logged in as a user who has the right to create
  content â€“ ask your system administrator if you are not sure; otherwise, some
  of the fields you need to select will not be visible. Select Add content from
  the front page ( either in the navigation menu or from the administrator menu
  ).

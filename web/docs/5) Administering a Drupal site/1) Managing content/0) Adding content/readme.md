This guide assumes that you have used the standard profile when installing, which defines the two content types _Basic Page_ and _Article_. (If you used the minimal profile, you need to [define content types](/node/774728 "Create a custom content type | Drupal 7 guide on Drupal.org") first.)

**Before we begin**: Make sure you are logged in as a user who has the right to create content â€“ ask your system administrator if you are not sure; otherwise, some of the fields you need to select will not be visible.

1. Select _Add content_ from the front page ( either in the navigation menu or from the administrator menu ).

1. This brings up a screen asking what type of content you wish to add. By default, Drupal 8 and higher comes with two content types _Article_ and _Basic Page_.

1. Select _Article_. The only major difference between _Basic Page_ and _Article_ is that you have the ability to upload an image when creating an _Article_; a _Basic Page_ is a static page. You can update the fields in the content type later.
2. A form will appear allowing you to enter information for your _Article_. You can also configure the revision log, menu, comment, authoring and promotion option settings. These settings vary as you [extend your Drupal instance](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/extending-drupal-8 "Extending Drupal 8 | Drupal 8 guide on Drupal.org") and [use the contributed modules](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/extending-drupal-8/installing-contributed-modules-find-import-enable-configure "Installing Drupal 8 Modules | Drupal 8 guide on Drupal.org").

1. Enter a _Title_ for the page in the _Title_ text box, for example, _Test Article_.
2. In the _Summary_ area enter some text that describes your article briefly.
3. In the _Body_ area enter some text. If you have an already written block of text for your site, you can just cut and paste it into this area. You can choose the formatting options from the _Text Forma_t drop-down below the text area. The default available options are _Basic HTML_, _Restricted HTML_ and _Full HTML_.
4. You can tag your content. To learn about tagging (Taxonomies) click [here](https://www.drupal.org/docs/7/organizing-content-with-taxonomies).
5. You can upload an image to your article.
6. A Published field (checkbox) provides you option to publish/unpublished the content.
7. Click _Save_.
8. You should now see your page (or "node" in Drupal-speak).

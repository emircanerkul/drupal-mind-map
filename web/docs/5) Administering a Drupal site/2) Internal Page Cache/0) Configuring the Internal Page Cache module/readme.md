On the Performance (`admin/config/development/performance`) page, you can configure how long browsers and proxies may cache pages. There is no other configuration. The value set for the maximum time a page can be cached by browsers and proxies will be used by `Cache-Control` headers. This setting is ignored by the Internal Page Cache itself, which caches pages permanently until invalidation unless they carry an `Expires` header.

Sometimes developers are rebuilding the entire cache of a Drupal instance manually on any code edit (e.g. via execution of the `drush cr` console command). That is not needed. Drupal enables you to disable caching entirely. Please read the following documentation page for preventing any confusion due to outdated rendering of your webpages: [Disable Drupal 8 caching during development](https://www.drupal.org/node/2598914).

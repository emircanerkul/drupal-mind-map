  Git branching model We work with a modified version of the Git flow branching
  model. We do not use a "develop" branch. Release branches Before a release is
  created, feature-branches are merged into the release dev-branch. Release
  branches are named according to this pattern:
  release/MAJOR-VERSION.(MINOR-VERSION.)x-dev Example names for release
  branches: release/2.x release/2.1.x release/2.1.x-dev Tagging release branches
  New versions are tagged on release branches. Whereas feature branches are
  closed when they are merged, release branches are never closed.

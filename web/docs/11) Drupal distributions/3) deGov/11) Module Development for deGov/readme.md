  This document outlines both vital and good-to-know information for developers
  working on Drupal modules in the context of the deGov distribution. General
  Information If you are new to developing custom Drupal modules, a good
  starting point is the official documentation on Drupal.org. All following
  sections assume you are at least somewhat familiar with the contents of the
  official documentation. Block Permissions If your custom module provides one
  or more blocks, you need to make sure you explicitly set permissions for these
  blocks for the role system_configurator.

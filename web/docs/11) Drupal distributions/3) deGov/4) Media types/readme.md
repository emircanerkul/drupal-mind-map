  deGov offers site editors an extensive list of types of media they can create
  and re-use in various contexts across their project. These range from basic
  types like images and simple documents to more complex structures such as
  video uploads and image galleries. Browsing media Editors can manage their
  media both from the Media tab of Drupal’s Content section, as well as from
  within a node form. New media content can be created directly from within a
  node using deGov’s Media Entity browser.

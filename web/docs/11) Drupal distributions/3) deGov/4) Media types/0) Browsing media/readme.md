Editors can manage their media both from the _Media_ tab of Drupal’s _Content_ section, as well as from within a node form.

New media content can be created directly from within a node using deGov’s _Media Entity_ browser. It provides type-appropriate inputs to upload new media using Dropzone.js or to, for example, paste a social media embed code.

Most media types are defined in distinct modules that can be enabled depending on the project’s needs. Where appropriate the modules will extend the _Media Entity_ browser with tabs allowing for the creation of new media content.

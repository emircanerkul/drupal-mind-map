On some paragraphs (like the Key metrics paragraph) it is also possible to define the Layout field. The available options are only those that are defined in the module's layouts.yml file. This is achieved by using the core's Layout Discovery module.

On the Content collection paragraph the layout is defined by views displays (See the view ino\_pt\_list\_nodes).

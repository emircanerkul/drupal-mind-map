  The distribution comes with its own theme (ino_basetheme) which is based on
  the Colonel theme. The theme contains only the source files (no css files,
  only scss), so it needs to be built before it can be used on the site. See the
  Installation page for more details. The theme also contains javascript files
  to help design the more dynamic paragraph types. These also use jQuery, which
  is standard in Drupal (See JavaScript API overview) A "subtheme_skeleton" is
  included to help creating a subtheme for ino_basetheme. Paragraph Styles The
  system adds a "Style" field to many of its paragraphs.

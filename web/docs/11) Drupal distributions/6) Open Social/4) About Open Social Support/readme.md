  Issues For any issues with the platform we kindly ask you to use the
  drupal.org issue queue. This way we can centralise all the information and
  make the feedback available for other users for documentation purposes. Next
  to giving people the credit they deserve. Slack We are available on Slack.
  Visit https://www.drupal.org/slack to see how you can join Drupal Slack. After
  that you can find us in the #opensocial channel. Our team will be available to
  answer your questions there.

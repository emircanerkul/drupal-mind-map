  Open Social Release Tags Open Social uses a three-part semantic versioning
  nomenclature within the constraints of drupal.org's current capabilities. See
  this drupal.org issue for the latest. The three parts of our versioning system
  are MAJOR.FEATURE.SPRINT. However, due to the current constraints of
  drupal.org, there is no separator between the FEATURE and SPRINT digits. This
  also limits Open Social to ten sprint releases before releasing a new feature.

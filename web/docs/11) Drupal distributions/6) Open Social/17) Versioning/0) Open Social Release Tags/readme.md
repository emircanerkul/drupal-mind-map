Open Social uses a three-part semantic versioning nomenclature within the constraints of drupal.org's current capabilities. See [this drupal.org issue](https://www.drupal.org/node/1612910) for the latest.

The three parts of our versioning system are MAJOR.FEATURE.SPRINT. However, due to the current constraints of drupal.org, there is no separator between the FEATURE and SPRINT digits. This also limits Open Social to ten sprint releases before releasing a new feature.

Given the following tag: 10.3.8:

| **10** | Major version of Open Social            |
| ------ | --------------------------------------- |
| **3**  | Feature release of Open Social          |
| **8**  | Sprint release between feature releases |

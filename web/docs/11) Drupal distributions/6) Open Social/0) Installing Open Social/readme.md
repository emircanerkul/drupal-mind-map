  Prerequisites We use composer for installing and updating Open Social. This is
  where you can get Composer, also for downloading it through drupal.org, you
  still need it for a proper installation. Server Requirements Pictures that are
  made on a mobile phone often do not have the correct orientation. To
  automatically set the correct orientation to images uploaded from your mobile
  phone you should have the php exif extension installed. This requirement is
  not mandatory and everything (except for autorotation) will work properly. See
  the PHP documentation here for more details.

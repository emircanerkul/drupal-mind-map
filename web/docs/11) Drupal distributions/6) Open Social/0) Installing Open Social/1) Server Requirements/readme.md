Pictures that are made on a mobile phone often do not have the correct orientation. To automatically set the correct orientation to images uploaded from your mobile phone you should have the `php exif` extension installed. This requirement is not mandatory and everything (except for autorotation) will work properly. See the PHP documentation [here](http://php.net/manual/en/book.exif.php) for more details.

As Open Social is a Drupal distribution, the usual [Drupal system requirements](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/system-requirements/) also apply.

Since version 11.5.x Open social requires webp extension enabled.

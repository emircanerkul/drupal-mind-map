  Open Social switched to using major version releases as well as minor version
  releases. Why? We came to realise that we were pushing a lot of new features
  and bug fixes in new releases. These new releases became quite big and more
  often than necessary users who were updating had to perform manual actions. In
  order to ease the pain of updating and give ourselves more room and a
  structured way to work on larger features and improvements, we introduced a
  different way of releasing. Every 3 months we plan to release a so-called
  major version.

Open Social switched to using major version releases as well as minor version releases.

### Why?

We came to realise that we were pushing a lot of new features and bug fixes in new releases. These new releases became quite big and more often than necessary users who were updating had to perform manual actions.

In order to ease the pain of updating and give ourselves more room and a structured way to work on larger features and improvements, we introduced a different way of releasing.

Every 3 months we plan to release a so-called major version. In between for supported versions we will also release minor versions.

### What is a major version release?

A major version release contains larger features and improvements that might take manual work or possibly introduce backwards compatibility breaking changes. We will try not to introduce such changes and will mention it clearly if we do.

New features will, where possible, be added as optional and by default disabled modules. Be sure to check the release notes so you don't miss them!

### What is a minor version release?

A minor version release consists of small improvements and bug fixes. They will not introduce new features.

### Updating

Please [refer to this page](https://www.drupal.org/docs/drupal-distributions/open-social/updating) for documentation on how to update your Open Social installation

### Support for older major versions

Older major versions will receive bug fixes and security updates until they are no longer supported.

### Schedule

Major version releases are scheduled to be released every 3 months.

In between minor version releases for support versions are released every month. It is possible that some will be skipped if not enough content is available for the release.

Security updates will be released for any of the supported versions if they are available.

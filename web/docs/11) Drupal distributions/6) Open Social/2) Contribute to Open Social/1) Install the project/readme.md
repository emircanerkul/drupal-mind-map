Development of the platform takes place on [GitHub](https://github.com/goalgorilla/open%5Fsocial). To get you started quickly, we have a [repository](https://github.com/goalgorilla/drupal%5Fsocial) with some Docker-compose files to install our [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/goalgorilla/drupal%5Fsocial/builds/).

Installation instructions can be found in the [Wiki](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/distributions/open-social/installing-and-updating). Developers may also want to install the packaged `social_devel` helper module which ensures most of the necessary development modules are installed.

Once you set up the project and verify that everything works properly you're ready to go!

* Always create or pick an issue in the [drupal.org issue queue](http://drupal.org/project/issues/social) for every pull request you are working on.
* When you create new issue please follow [Issue Summary Template standards](https://www.drupal.org/issue-summaries).
* Always cross-reference the Issue in the Pull Request and the Pull Request in the Issue.
* Always create a new branch for every pull request: its name should contain a brief summary of the ticket and its issue id, `e.g feature/2747585-group-comments`.
* Donâ€™t forget about [Drupal coding standards](https://www.drupal.org/coding-standards) and our [Open Social development standards](https://www.drupal.org/docs/distributions/open-social/development-standards).

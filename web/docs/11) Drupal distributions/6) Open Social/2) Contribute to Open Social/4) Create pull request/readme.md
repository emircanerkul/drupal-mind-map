Remember to create a branch before you start developing! Its name should contain the issue ID and a slug to explain what you are working on. For example: **feature/2747585-group-comments**.

Once you finish development, push your commits to your fork:

```php
git commit -a -m "Issue 2747585 by <drupal.org username>: Fix open group content permissions"
git push fork feature/2747585-group-comments

```

You can now go to your fork's GitHub page and create a pull request.

Your pull request should link to the drupal.org issue, and vice-versa.

When you are ready to create a Pull Request, it would be nice to have Steps For Review within your Pull Requests summary. This helps others understand how to test or bug fix your feature.

After your code has been reviewed, you might be asked to perform some changes and then have it reviewed again. Updating the branch will automatically update the related pull request.

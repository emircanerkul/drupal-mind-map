While the code is stored on GitHub, the issue queue is still handled at drupal.org. You can look at the [open issues \[213 issues\]](https://www.drupal.org/project/issues/search/social?project%5Fissue%5Ffollowers=&status%5B%5D=Open&version%5B%5D=any%5F11.&issue%5Ftags%5Fop=%3D), pick one you like and **assign it to yourself**.

Or go directly to the list of [feature requests](https://www.drupal.org/project/issues/social?text=&status=Open&priorities=All&categories=3&version=All&component=All) which show you all the features the community wants to see in Open Social, it would be great if you can help out.

If you are working with composer dependencies it's a bit more involved to get set up; scroll down to the section "Working with Composer Issues."

If you still need help choosing an issue or working on one, join [the drupal.slack.com #opensocial channel](https://drupal.slack.com/messages/C4DQ2Q6BW) Wednesday’s from 4-5pm and Friday’s from 10-11am.

Tip: You can also view the issue queue as a [Kanban board](https://contribkanban.com/board/social).

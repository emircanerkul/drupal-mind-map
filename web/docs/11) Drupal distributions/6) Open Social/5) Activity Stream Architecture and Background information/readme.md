  Introduction The architecture for the activity stream is built to be pluggable
  in many ways. First it is good to understand the main concepts of a Message
  and Activity Entity and how they are connected to each other. The Message
  entity is built from a Message Type that contains tokenized text and is
  created when an event is triggered (e.g. a content entity that is created).
  The message does not contain the recipients or list of users that need to
  receive this notification and the final output that is displayed from the
  tokenized output. To store this information we use the Activity entity.

  While Drupal 8 or higher ships with only a few Field Formatter plugins for
  each field type, there are many contributed modules that add useful and
  easy-to-use field formatters. The goal of this guide is to make it easy to
  find what contributed Field Formatters are available for each core field type.
  This (incomplete!) guide is only intended to give information on contributed
  modules that enhance the display of core field types. This guide does not
  intend to rate or rank these contributed modules in any way.

While Drupal 8 or higher ships with only a few [Field Formatter plugins](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/api/entity-api/fieldtypes-fieldwidgets-and-fieldformatters#s-fieldformatters) for each field type, there are many contributed modules that add useful and easy-to-use field formatters. The goal of this guide is to make it easy to find what contributed Field Formatters are available for each core field type.

This (incomplete!) guide is only intended to give information on contributed modules that enhance the display of [core field types](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/api/entity-api/fieldtypes-fieldwidgets-and-fieldformatters#s-fieldtypes). This guide does not intend to rate or rank these contributed modules in any way. Any supported contributed module with at least an alpha release can be added to the lists in alphabetical order, provided the module includes a generally useful field formatter for a core field type.

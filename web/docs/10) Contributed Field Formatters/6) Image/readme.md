  Drupal 8 ships with three Field Formatters for Image fields: Image, Url to
  Image, and Responsive Image. (For the last one, you must enable the core
  responsive_image module.) There are many, many contributed modules that
  provide additional field formatters for image fields. Since there are so many,
  we try to roughly categorize the contributed field formatters.

  For most core entity reference fields, there are three Field Formatters:
  Entity ID, Label, and Rendered Entity. There are some special cases of entity
  reference fields that have additional core field formatters. For example,
  Taxonomy reference fields include the RSS Category formatter while Media
  reference fields include the Thumbnail field formatter. The following
  contributed modules provide additional field formatters for entity reference
  fields. Some of the field formatters are only useful for or applicable to a
  specific type of entity reference field.

These modules do neat things related to Field Formatters, but don't fit into this guide cleanly.

* [Formatter Field](https://www.drupal.org/project/formatter%5Ffield)  
   * Provides a mechanism for specifying a formatter and formatter settings to be used for displaying a field, on a per-entity basis
* [Dynamic Entity Reference](https://www.drupal.org/project/dynamic%5Fentity%5Freference)  
   * Provides a field type/widget/formatter combination for Drupal 8 that allows an entity-reference field to reference more than one entity type
* [Entity Reference Display](https://www.drupal.org/project/entity%5Freference%5Fdisplay)  
   * Defines a simple field type for display mode selection for entity reference fields. This allows an editor to select how they would like the references displayed.

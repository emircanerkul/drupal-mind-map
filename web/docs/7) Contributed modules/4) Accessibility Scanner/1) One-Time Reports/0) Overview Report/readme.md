Each individual URL scanned has a chart and table breaking down violations (by severity) and elements needing review.

* **Distinct** \- If the same rule is violated multiple times (e.g., multiple images are missing alt tags), it will only count once.
* **Total** \- If the same rule is violated multiple times (e.g., multiple images are missing alt tags), it will count for every single instance that is missing the alt tag.

A suite of Paragraph bundles made with the Bootstrap framework.

For content creators, attempts to use WYSIWYG editors to create structured  
layouts typically lead to frustration and compromise. With this module, you can  
easily position chunks of content (Paragraph bundles) within a structured  
layout of your own design.

This suite of [Paragraphs bundles](https://www.drupal.org/project/paragraphs) works within the [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) framework.

This module is built on the premise that all good things in Drupal 8 are  
entities and we can use Paragraphs and Reference fields to allow our content  
creators to harness the power of the Bootstrap framework for functionality  
and layout.

  Requirements: Paragraphs Bootstrap Paragraphs Contact Formatter How to
  Configure: Navigate to the content type and add a new field to type Entity
  revisions, Paragraphs. Allow unlimited so creators can add more that one
  Paragraph to the node. On the field edit screen, the user can add
  instructions, and choose which bundles the user wants to allow for this field.
  Check all but Accordion Section and Tab Section. Those should only be used
  inside Accordions and Tabs. Arrange them as necessary. We prefer Simple,
  Image, and Blank at the top, then the rest in Alphabetical order. Select Save
  Settings.

  Requirements: Paragraphs Bootstrap Paragraphs Webform How to configure:
  Navigate to the content type and add a new field to type Entity revisions,
  Paragraphs. Allow unlimited so creators can add more that one Paragraph to the
  node. On the field edit screen, the user can add instructions, and choose
  which bundles to allow for this field. Select all but Accordion Section and
  Tab Section. Those should only be used inside Accordions and Tabs. Arrange
  them as desired. We prefer Simple, Image, and Blank at the top, then the rest
  in Alphabetical order. Select Save Settings.

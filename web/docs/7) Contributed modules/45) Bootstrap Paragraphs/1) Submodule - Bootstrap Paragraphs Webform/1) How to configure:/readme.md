2. Allow unlimited so creators can add more that one Paragraph to the node.
3. On the field edit screen, the user can add instructions, and choose which bundles to allow for this field. Select all but Accordion Section and Tab Section. Those should only be used inside Accordions and Tabs.
4. Arrange them as desired. We prefer Simple, Image, and Blank at the top, then the rest in Alphabetical order. Select Save Settings.
5. Adjust the form display, placing the field desired.
6. Add the field into the Manage display tab.

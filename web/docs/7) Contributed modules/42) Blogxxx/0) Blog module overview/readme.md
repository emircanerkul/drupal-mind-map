  The Blog module allows authorized users to maintain a blog. Blogs are a series
  of posts that are time stamped and are typically viewed by date as you would
  view a journal. Blog entries can be made public or private to the site
  members, depending on which roles have access to view content. The Blog module
  was removed from Drupal 8 core, and is now a contributed module. It used to be
  included in core for Drupal 7 and earlier.

The [Blog module](/project/blog) allows authorized users to maintain a blog. Blogs are a series of posts that are time stamped and are typically viewed by date as you would view a journal. Blog entries can be made public or private to the site members, depending on which roles have access to view content.

The [Blog module](/project/blog) was removed from Drupal 8 core, and is now a contributed module. It used to be included in core for Drupal 7 and earlier.

The Blog module adds a _blogs_ navigation link to the main navigation menu (the link must be enabled), which takes a visitor to a page that displays the most recent blog entries from all the users on the site. For authorized users, the navigation menu has a _create content_  link (which takes the user to a page with a link to a submission form) and a _my blog_ link (which displays the user's blog entries as other people will see them). The blog module also creates a _recent blog posts_ block that can be enabled.

Drupal also provides an RSS 2.0 feed for each blog.

**You can:**

* Read your blog via your user profile at **my account**.
* Post a blog at **Content > Add content > Blog entry.**

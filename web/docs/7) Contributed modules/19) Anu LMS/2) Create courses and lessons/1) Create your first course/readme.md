This is a step-by-step instruction on how to create a course in Anu LMS.

### 1\. Open the "Create Course" content form

Go to Drupal administration » Content » Add content » Course (`/node/add/course`).

Fill in the Title field for your course.

### 2\. Fill in the Info tab

Upload the cover image for your course in the Image field. Don't forget to specify Alternative text for the image.

Optionally fill in other fields on the Info tab. You will be able to edit them at any time later.

### 3\. Prepare course structure on the Modules tab

Open the “Modules” tab and specify the title for the first module.

Click “Add new lesson” and specify the title of the first lesson. Click “Create Lesson”. Repeat until you've added all lessons for the first module.

Click the “Add Course module” button to add one more module for your course. Add some lessons to the second module.

### 4\. Fill in the Settings tab

Finally, go to the Settings tab.

Specify the”Course finish button” path, for example `<front>`. Review other available settings and choose the most appropriate values for your use case.

Click the Save button. Congratulations! You've prepared the structure for your new course!

### 5\. Add lesson content

Once your course is created, you should be redirected to the first lesson of that course. If it didn't happen, find your course in the list of content and click on its title.

To add content to individual lessons, edit them as you would edit any other Drupal content.

Edit the first lesson of the course.

Click the “Add block” button to add blocks to the first lesson page. Pick a few simple blocks to get started and click the Save button.

Congratulations! You've just created your first lesson!

### 6\. Experiment with content

Now when the basics are configured, feel free to add more content to different lessons. Experiment with different block types, break lesson content into multiple pages, add more lessons and reorder existing ones. Go creative!

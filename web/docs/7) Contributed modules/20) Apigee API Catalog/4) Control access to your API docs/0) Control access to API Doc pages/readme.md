You can allow anonymous users to view published API documentation pages in your developer portal, or restrict documentation to registered users, by controlling access through user permissions. To enable or restrict access:

1. Log in to your portal as a user with admin or content creation privileges.
2. Navigate to **People > Permissions > Apigee API Catalog > View published API docs** in the Drupal admin menu.
3. Select the desired permissions for each user role.
4. Click **Save permissions.**

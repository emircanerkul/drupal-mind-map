  Expose REST APIs to interact with API Docs The following sections describe how
  to set up a REST API to create, read, update, or delete API Docs entities. The
  REST endpoints exposed through the steps below handle authentication and
  permissions using HTTP basic authentication. If your workflow uses Maven, you
  can use the Apigee Maven SmartDocs Plugin to automate this process.
  Prerequisites Before you begin, make sure to: Install Composer in your local
  environment to download Drupal modules, dependencies, and patches. See
  Download Composer for instructions.

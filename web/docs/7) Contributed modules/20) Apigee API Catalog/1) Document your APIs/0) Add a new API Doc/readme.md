Once an API Doc is added, its name, description, and optional image will be displayed as a card in a gallery format on the **APIs** landing page. Your API Doc cards can be filtered and displayed on the **APIs** landing page by category. Clicking on the **View Documentation** link on the bottom of each API Doc card will take you to the Smart Docs rendering of your API specification.

To add a new API Doc:

1. Log in to your portal as a user with admin or content creation privileges.
2. Navigate to **Content** \> **API Catalog** in the Drupal admin menu.
3. Click +**Add API Doc.** The **Add API Doc** form will display.  
   1. Enter the name of the API doc you are adding.  
   2. Select the OpenAPI specification source for the API Doc. The OpenAPI spec can be directly uploaded as a JSON or  
    YAML file, or associated to a source location such as Apigee Edge or a URL.  
         1. To upload a spec file, select **File**, and then select the file to upload using the file picker.  
         2. To use a URL source location, select **URL**, and then enter the full file URL under **URL to OpenAPI specification file**.  
   3. Add an optional description for the API spec you are documenting. This description will be visible to developers on the **APIs** landing page once the API Doc is published.  
   4. Add one more more categories to your API Doc using the autocomplete list. To add more than one category to an API Doc, click **Add another item** under **Categories**. These categories will be used to filter your API Docs for display on the APIs landing page.  
   5. Add an image to your API Doc. The image will appear on the API Doc card as it is displayed on the **APIs** landing page. Click **Add media** to open the media dialog. You can upload a new image file, or select and image from the prepopulated image gallery.
4. Click **Save**.

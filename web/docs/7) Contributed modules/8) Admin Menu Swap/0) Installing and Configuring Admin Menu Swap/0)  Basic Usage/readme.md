Once Admin Menu Swap is enabled and your menus and user roles are established, you can pair the appropriate menu and role together. 

For example, you could create a "Content Editor" menu that has links to just the Content, Media and Taxonomy administrative pages. You could then pair that menu with the "Content editor" user role.

To do this, navigate to <em>Configuration > System > Admin Menu Swap</em>.

You can create as many role-menu pairs as there are user roles.

Once a role-menu pair is established, the assigned menu will now appear as the admin menu for users logged in with the specified role.

For example, here is the "Content Editor" menu showing for users with _Content editor_ role.

  Breakgen the breakpoint to image style generator. Ever felt that manually
  updating breakpoints and media queries was time consuming? No more manual
  mapping from breakpoints to image styles to responsive image styles! Breakgen
  introduces the drush bg command which generates image styles. Configuration of
  the generated image styles depends on the configuration provided by the
  breakgen key within the breakpoint file.

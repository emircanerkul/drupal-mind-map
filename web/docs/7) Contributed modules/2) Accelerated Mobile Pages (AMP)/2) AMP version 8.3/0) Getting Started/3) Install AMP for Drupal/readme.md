You should be [using Composer to manage Drupal site dependencies](https://www.drupal.org/docs/develop/using-composer/using-composer-to-manage-drupal-site-dependencies).

With Composer, adding AMP tools to your site project is much like adding other modules or themes with Composer. On the command line, enter the following commands in your project root directory:

```php
composer require drupal/amp
```

If you want to create a custom AMP theme, add that theme to the /themes directory.

* Enable the AMP module.
* Install at least one AMP theme, which can be the ExAMPle subtheme included in amptheme or a custom AMP theme you create.
* To install an AMP subtheme through the user interface, go to \`/admin/appearance\`.
* Install the AMP theme, but do not make it the default theme. AMP themes will automatically be used only on AMP pages.
* Go to the theme settings page, \`/admin/appearance/settings/{AMP-SUBTHEME-NAME}\`. Uncheck the box to use the theme's default logo and upload a logo for the AMP subtheme, then save that change. An AMP logo should be no bigger than 60px high and 600px wide, so you may need a different logo than your primary theme.

The AMP module is designed to convert Drupal pages into pages that comply with the AMP standard. At this time, only node pages are converted.

When the AMP module is installed, AMP can be enabled for any node type. At that point, AMP content becomes available on URLs such as \`node/1?amp\` or \`node/article-title?amp\`. There are also special formatters for text, image, and video fields geared towards outputting the appropriate AMP components.

This step is true for all AMP themes. There is a special system branding block that should be used on AMP pages. When configuring the blocks for your AMP theme, be sure to omit the standard system branding block and instead use the special AMP system branding block. The AMP block requires that you identify the width and height of the logo image. Note that AMP logo images should be no wider than 600px and no taller than 60px. The standard system branding block creates invalid AMP markup and you'll see validation errors until you switch it out.

  The 8.3 branch of the AMP module is a place to develop new features and
  functionality for Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP). Make it possible to create
  an AMP theme that is a subtheme of your normal theme so AMP pages look more
  like the rest of your pages. Add more AMP components, like carousels,
  sidebars, social media sharing, etc. Make it possible to have an AMP-only
  site, where the AMP page is the canonical page instead of an alternate page.
  Use the 8.3 version of both AMP and AMPTheme, they are intended to work
  together. This site provides documentation of the new branch.

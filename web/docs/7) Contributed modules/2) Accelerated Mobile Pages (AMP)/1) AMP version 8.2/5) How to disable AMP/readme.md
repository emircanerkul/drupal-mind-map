If you choose to disable AMP on your site for one or all content types, you can do so through the AMP configuration page at `/admin/config/content/amp`.

* View the list of AMP-enabled content types.
* For each AMP-enabled content type you wish to disable, click the link to "Disable AMP in Custom Display Settings".
* Open the "Custom Display Settings" fieldset, uncheck AMP, and click the Save button (this brings you back to the AMP config form).

Once the AMP view mode is disabled, that content type will no longer display AMP-formatted pages when `?amp=1` is appended to a URL for that content.

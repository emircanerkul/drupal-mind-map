The Aggregator module is a feed reader. When enabled, the Aggregator module can fetch syndicated content from other websites.

The Aggregator module can gather, read, and display news, text, images, and other content from external news sites and blogs around the internet. The Aggregator module **fetches** content from other sites; it does not generate syndication feeds. To enable XML syndication on _your_ site, turn on the Syndicate block _**Administer > Structure > Blocks**_.

When used with other modules, the Aggregator module can make these feed items available from a Drupal site using common syndication formats including RSS, Atom, and RDF. ([Learn more about site syndication formats](http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2002/12/18/dive-into-xml.html).)

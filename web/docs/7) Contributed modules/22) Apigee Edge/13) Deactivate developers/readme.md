Deactivate a developer and prevent them from using any of their apps using one of the following methods:

* [Deactivate a developer on the developer portal](#deactivating-a-developer-on-the-developer-portal). _This approach is recommended_. In this case, the developer will not be able to log into the developer portal, and assigned API keys will be deactivated and no longer work.
* [Deactivate a developer on Apigee Edge](#deactivating-a-developer-on-apigee-edge)**.** The developer will be able to log into the developer portal, but assigned API keys will be deactivated and no longer work. The developer will be notified about the deactivated API keys on the My Apps page.

**Note**: The developer's apps still retain their approved (or other) status, as do the API keys, even though the keys are not valid while the developer is deactivated.

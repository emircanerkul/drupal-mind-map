App developers can register apps to access the resources in your API products. When registering an app, app developers select the API product to include and Apigee generates a key. Each app has a single key that provides access to multiple API products.

You can register a [developer app](#register-dev-app) or a [team app](#register-team-app), as described in the following sections.

**Note**: Apps allow you to control who can access your resources. You can control who has access to your API products by revoking and refreshing an app's key. And you can control access to bundles of resources by revoking or deleting access to the API products in an app. For more information, see [Register apps and managing API keys](https://docs.apigee.com/api-platform/publish/creating-apps-surface-your-api) in the Apigee documentation.

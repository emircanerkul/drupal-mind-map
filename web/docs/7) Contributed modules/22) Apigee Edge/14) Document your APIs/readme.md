  If your APIs can be described with an OpenAPI Specification, you may want to
  document them on your developer portal. Publishing API documentation to your
  portals makes it easy for your developers to learn, test, and evaluate your
  APIs. The Apigee API Catalog module transforms valid OpenAPI specifications in
  JSON or YAML format into easy-to-use documentation rendered with SmartDocs.
  For information on installing and using the Apigee API Catalog module to
  describe your APIs, see the Apigee API Catalog documentation.

The Apigee API Catalog module transforms valid OpenAPI specifications in JSON or YAML format into easy-to-use documentation rendered with SmartDocs. For information on installing and using the Apigee API Catalog module to describe your APIs, see the [Apigee API Catalog documentation](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/modules/apigee-api-catalog).

You can also enable developers using your portal to test and simulate calls to your backend services using SmartDocs. To learn more about the SmartDocs library, see [Use SmartDocs with Apigee Edge](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/modules/apigee-api-catalog/use-smartdocs-with-apigee-edge).

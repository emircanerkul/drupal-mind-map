Create one or more roles to be globally available for each team. Team administrators can then set one of the globally defined roles for each team member.

**Note**: The "member" role will be granted to all team members automatically. As a result, this role can be used to configure default [permissions for roles](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/modules/apigee-edge/configure-team-management#s-configure-permissions-for-roles).

To create a Team role:

1. Select **Configuration > Apigee Edge > Teams**.
2. Click the **Roles** tab.
3. Click **Add role** to add a new role.
4. Complete the form.
5. Click **Save**.

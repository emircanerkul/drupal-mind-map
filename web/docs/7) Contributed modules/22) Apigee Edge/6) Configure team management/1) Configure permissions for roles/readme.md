Configure the permissions that are enabled for each role you created. By default, all newly created roles will have "member" role permissions enabled. If you want to remove a permission enabled by default in a newly created role, you must first remove that permission from the "member" role.

To configure additional Team permissions for roles:

1. Select **Configuration > Apigee Edge > Teams**.
2. Click the **Permissions** tab.
3. Configure the permissions, as required, to enable team members to:  
   * Add or remove other team members  
   * Create, edit, delete or view analytics for team apps  
   * View and assign public, private, or internal API products to team apps  
   * Manage or accept team invitations.
4. Click **Save configuration**.

To configure additional Global permissions, select **People > Permissions**.

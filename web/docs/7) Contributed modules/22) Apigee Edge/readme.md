The Apigee Edge module lets you connect your Drupal developer portal site with Apigee Edge, Apigee X, and Apigee hybrid organizations.

This document describes the Apigee Edge module for Drupal. Apigee encourages customers to install and evaluate the module, provide feedback, and make contributions.

**Note**: If you are new to Drupal or Drupal-based developer portals, we strongly recommend using the Apigee Developer Portal Kickstart distribution to get up and running quickly. The Kickstart bundles together the open source Apigee Drupal modules required to create a portal, connect to Apigee, showcase your API products, and publish your API reference documentation. For more information, see the Apigee Developer Portal Kickstart [project page](https://www.drupal.org/project/apigee%5Fdevportal%5Fkickstart) and [documentation](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/modules/apigee-developer-portal-kickstart).

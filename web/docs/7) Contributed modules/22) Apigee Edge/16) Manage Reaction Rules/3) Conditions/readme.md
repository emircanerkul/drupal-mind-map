You can further customize task automation in your developer portal by specifying Conditions. If an Event is detected by the module, and your Condition is met, the correlating Action is implemented. The Actions module offers a number of built-in Conditions that can be added to your Rules, or you can extend the module with custom Conditions. To learn more about defining custom Conditions for Events and Actions within the Actions module, see **[How to implement custom conditions](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/modules/d8-rules-essentials/for-developers/conditions)**.

  Manage Reaction Rules with Apigee Edge Actions (Experimental) The Apigee Edge
  Actions module (Experimental) provides out-of-the-box Drupal Reaction Rules
  integration for use with Apigee Edge. The Actions module makes it easy to
  react to specified events within your developer portal and respond with
  automated tasks. For example, the module can be used to: Send an email
  notification when an App is created. Notify a developer when the developer is
  added to a Team. Notify an admin when an API product is added to an App.

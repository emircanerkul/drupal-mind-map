The Apigee Edge Actions module (Experimental) provides out-of-the-box Drupal Reaction Rules integration for use with Apigee Edge. The Actions module makes it easy to react to specified events within your developer portal and respond with automated tasks. For example, the module can be used to:

* Send an email notification when an App is created.
* Notify a developer when the developer is added to a Team.
* Notify an admin when an API product is added to an App.

**Note:** As with Drupal Experimental modules, some Apigee Drupal submodules are marked as “Experimental.” These submodules are provided for evaluation and testing purposes but are considered to be in development. Experimental modules are included in the **Apigee (Experimental)** package on the “**Extend** page of the Drupal administration menu (/admin/modules).

If you do not configure the connection between the developer portal and Apigee Edge, you will not be able to register developers on the developer portal (see [What information is stored on Apigee Edge?](what-information-is-stored-on-apigee-edge)) and may cause other issues with Drupal core functions. If you do not plan to configure the connection between the developer portal and Apigee Edge, you should disable the Apigee Edge module.

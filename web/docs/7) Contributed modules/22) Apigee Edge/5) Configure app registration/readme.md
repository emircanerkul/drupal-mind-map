  Before developers can use your APIs, they must register on the developer
  portal. After they log in, developers can use the My Apps or Team Apps page to
  register apps, choose the API products they want to use, and access the unique
  API credentials (consumer keys and secrets) needed to access your APIs. If you
  have installed the Apigee Developer Portal Kickstart distribution, you can use
  the Apps page for this functionality. Configure the app registration process,
  as described in the following sections: Note: Steps to configure both
  developer apps and teams apps are described.

Before developers can use your APIs, they must [register](how-app-developers-interact-with-the-apigee-edge-module#registering-an-app-developer-account) on the developer portal. After they log in, developers can use the My Apps or Team Apps page to [register apps](how-app-developers-interact-with-the-apigee-edge-module#registering-an-app), choose the API products they want to use, and [access the unique API credentials](how-app-developers-interact-with-the-apigee-edge-module#view-api-key) (consumer keys and secrets) needed to access your APIs. If you have installed the Apigee Developer Portal Kickstart distribution, you can use the Apps page for this functionality.

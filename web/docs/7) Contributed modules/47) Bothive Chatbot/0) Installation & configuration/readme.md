  Installation requirements This module requires no modules outside of Drupal
  core. You do need to have a valid API key and have your website whitelisted as
  an allowed domain to be able to embed the chatbot. (More information can be
  found below under configuration). Install as you would normally install a
  contributed Drupal module. Visit https://www.drupal.org/node/1897420 for
  further information. Configuration First of all you'll need to have an API key
  from Bothive.

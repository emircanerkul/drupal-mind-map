This module requires no modules outside of Drupal core.

You do need to have a valid API key and have your website whitelisted as an allowed domain to be able to embed the chatbot. (More information can be found below under configuration).

Install as you would normally install a contributed Drupal module. Visit <https://www.drupal.org/node/1897420> for further information.

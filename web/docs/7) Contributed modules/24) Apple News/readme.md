  Apple News module allows integrating content managed in Drupal to Apple News,
  a news publishing platform using the APIs provided by Apple. Important changes
  from the Drupal 7 version: D7 instructions recommend installing
  chapter-three/apple-news-api but that may generate an error message and
  appears to be unnecessary. Once installed, configured and enabled, edit the
  content type chosen for the template and add a new 'Apple News' field. This
  will provide a checkbox in all nodes of that content type for submitting to
  Apple News (look to the right in the edit window).

* From your administrative menu, go to _Structure > Paragraph Types_ and click on "Manage Fields" next to "A11Y Paragraphs Tab Content". This "A11Y Paragraphs Tab Content" [paragraph](https://www.drupal.org/project/paragraphs) is the paragraph type for content inside each tab.

![Select a field type](https://www.drupal.org/files/adding-fields--select-field-type.png)

* For the purpose of this demonstration I am going to add an image field. Select "Image" and add a title for your field. You can also change the machine name of your field if you are into custom field names. Click "Save and Continue"

![Add Image field](https://www.drupal.org/files/adding-fields--add-image-field.png)

* On the next screen, select how many images you want to allow to be added under 'Allowed number of values". Click "Save field settings".
* On the next screen, you can add Help text to the field for anyone adding content to understand what the field is for. You can also make other changes on this screen if you want to. Click "Save Settings".
* The field has now been created.

![The field has now been created](https://www.drupal.org/files/adding-fields--field-added.png)

* Now you can click on the "Manage display"-tab and hide the label for the field. You generally do not want the field label to show on your finished page. Then click "Save"

![Hide label under "Manage Display"](https://www.drupal.org/files/addng-fields--manage-display.png)

* Now you field is set up and ready to add content.
* In a previous document I explained how to add the paragraph to your content type: <https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/modules/a11y-paragraphs-tabs/setting-up-a11y-paragraphs-tabs> . Do this now if you haven't added it to your content type yet.
* To add content, click on Content>Add Content and click on the content type you want to add and on which you have added the paragraph to.
* I'm going to be adding a Basic Page.

![Adding content with our new tabs paragraph](https://www.drupal.org/files/adding-fields--add-content.png)

* You will see our Tabs paragraph. You can either fill in a section title or not. Leave blank if you don't want a title.
* Click on "Add A11Y Paragraphs Tabs Panel" to add a Tab.

![Click to add panel](https://www.drupal.org/files/adding-fields--add-paragraph.png)

* Add a Tab Title and then click on the "Add A11Y Paragraphs Tabs Content" to add the content field. We made it not open all the fields at once when you edit or add new content so that it is not too overwhelming on the page.

![Click on "Add A11Y Paragraphs Tab Content"](https://www.drupal.org/files/adding-fields--add-tab-content.png)

* You will then see your newly added Image field. Or whichever field(s) you added.

![You will see your newly added field in the tab content area](https://www.drupal.org/files/adding-fields--add-tab-content-open.png)

* Add your image and text. And then to add another tab, click on "Add A11Y Paragraphs Tabs Panel"

![To add another tab, click on "Add A11Y Paragraphs Tabs Panel"](https://www.drupal.org/files/adding-fields--add-second-tab.png)

* You can add as many tabs as you want. After you have added all the tabs you want, click on "Save" and you should now see your tabs in action

![Finished Product](https://www.drupal.org/files/adding-fields--finished.png)

* And on mobile it will be an accordion

And that is how you add a field to the content area of your tabs.

I hope you found this documentation helpful.

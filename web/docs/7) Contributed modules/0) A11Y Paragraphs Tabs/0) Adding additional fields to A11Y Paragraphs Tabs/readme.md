  After installation, the A11Y Paragraphs Tabs module provides a single text
  field. The long text field that comes added on this component has a CKEditor
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG editor that gives you the ability to add
  text, images, tables, and links. However, there may be some cases where you
  want to represent this data as additional fields, rather than within a long
  text field. Process From your administrative menu, go to Structure > Paragraph
  Types and click on "Manage Fields" next to "A11Y Paragraphs Tab Content".

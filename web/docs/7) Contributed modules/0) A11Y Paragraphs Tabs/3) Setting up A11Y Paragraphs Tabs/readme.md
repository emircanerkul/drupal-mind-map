  The first thing you need to do after you have installed the module is to add
  it to a content type so that you can use it. If you are not familiar with how
  Paragraphs work, I will explain step by step on how to add it to the content
  type so you can use it when creating your nodes as well as adding extra fields
  to your tabs. Out of the box you only need to to add the paragraph to your
  content type and you can start using it. If you want more fields or paragraphs
  added to the content area of the tab, then I will explain that further down
  this documentation.

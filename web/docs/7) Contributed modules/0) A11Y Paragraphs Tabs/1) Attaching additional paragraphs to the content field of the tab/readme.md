In this document we will be showing you how to easily attach additional paragraphs to the content area of your tabs. Out of the box the A11Y Paragraphs Tabs only has one text field. But it is easy to add additional fields or paragraphs to the content area. In [another document](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/modules/a11y-paragraphs-tabs/adding-additional-fields-to-a11y-paragraphs-tabs) we have covered how to add additional fields to the content area of the tab.

We are going to be attaching additional paragraphs so that we have additional paragraphs/fields available in our content area of the tab.

* First, go to Structure>Paragraph Types and click on "Manage fields" next to "A11Y Paragraphs Tabs Panel".

![Click on "Manage fields" next to "Tab Content"](https://www.drupal.org/files/add-paragraphs-edit.png)

* Check/select the paragraphs you want to add to the content area.

![Check/Select the paragraphs you want to attach to the content area](https://www.drupal.org/files/add-paragraphs-attach-paragraphs.png)

* For demonstration purposes I am going to check/select the two paragraphs I have namely "My special icon paragraph" and "My special image paragraph". But you can add any paragraphs that you have under "Paragraph Types".

* Click on "Save settings"
* Now your extra paragraphs have been attached to the content area of the tabs.
* Now you can add content.

Adding content:

* Click on Content>Add content and select the content type you want to add.

* Add Section title if needed
* Then click on "Add A11Y Paragraphs Tabs Panel"
* Add the title for your tab and click on dropdown caret next to "Add A11Y Paragraphs Tab Content" and you will see all the paragraphs you have attached in the previous steps.

* Select which paragraphs you want to add and keep adding as needed. It is set to unlimited so you can add as many of the paragraphs/entries as you want. And it will display in the order of how you added them.

That is how you add/attach additional paragraphs to your tab's content area.

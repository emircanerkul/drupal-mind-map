  There are two pieces to every chatbot - a BotmanChatbot plugin which provides
  the business logic of your chatbot, and a BotmanWidget plugin which provides
  the interface. The module provides a few widgets you can use right out of the
  box including a web widget (provided by the botman framework), and an embed
  widget, which embeds the chatbot in the content of a page. Chatbots are added
  to the site using the Botman Chatbot block type. When adding the block, you
  can select the BotmanChatbot plugin to use as well as the BotmanWidget to
  display it.

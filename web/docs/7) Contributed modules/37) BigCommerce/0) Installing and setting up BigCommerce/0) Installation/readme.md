Install as you would normally install a contributed Drupal module.

`$ composer require drupal/bigcommerce $ drush en bigcommerce`

Using composer is highly recommended as this module requires the use of the [moderntribe/bigcommerce-api-php-v3](https://github.com/moderntribe/bigcommerce-api-php-v3) 3rd party library.

See <https://www.drupal.org/docs/user%5Fguide/en/extend-module-install.html> for further information.

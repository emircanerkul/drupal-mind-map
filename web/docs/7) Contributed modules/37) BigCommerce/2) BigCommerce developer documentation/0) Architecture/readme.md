  The BigCommerce module leverages Commerce and Migrate (provided by Drupal
  core). Products Commerce products are created to store products from
  BigCommerce. As you created and configure products in BigCommerce the sync
  will create any necessary fields, product types, taxonomies and vocabularies
  in Drupal. BigCommerce is treated as the single source of truth and so an
  updates made there will overwrite any changes to products made on the Drupal
  side. Products should be created, updated and deleted in BigCommerce. It is
  the single source of truth.

BigCommerce products in your Drupal site are regular commerce products and can be extended via the Commerce admin user interface. It is important that the BigCommerce API is treated as the single source of truth for product information maintained in BigCommerce. Fields can be added to your commerce products and these will not be affected by synchronisation. However all data that originates from BigCommerce will override any changes you make, for example, to the product title.

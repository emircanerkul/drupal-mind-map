  Introduction The Block Form Alter module provides functions to alter block
  forms consistently across implementing plugins: hook_block_plugin_form_alter()
  hook_block_type_form_alter() Block forms are rendered by implementing plugins,
  which may require duplicate code in some instances where a developer desires
  to alter a given block form. This is particularly true when altering forms
  rendered by Layout Builder. hook_block_plugin_form_alter() The
  hook_block_plugin_form_alter() function allows for block forms to be targeted
  by plugin id.

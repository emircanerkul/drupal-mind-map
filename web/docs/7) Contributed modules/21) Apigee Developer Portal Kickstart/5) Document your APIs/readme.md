  The Kickstart distribution also includes the Apigee API Catalog module, which
  lets you document your APIs in your Drupal developer portal. Publishing API
  documentation to your portals makes it easy for your developers to learn, test
  and evaluate your APIs. The Apigee API Catalog module transforms valid OpenAPI
  specifications in JSON or YAML format into easy-to-use documentation rendered
  with SmartDocs. When you create your portal using the Apigee Developer Portal
  Kickstart distribution, the Apigee API Catalog module will be installed for
  you.

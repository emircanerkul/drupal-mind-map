If your Drupal 7 developer portal uses additional custom fields and entity types, the default migrations available in the module will not provide all the migrations you need. You can extend the default migrations to add your own custom fields. The `apigee_kickstart_migrate_example` module contains examples showing how to extend and run migrations with custom fields. For additional information about customizing migrations, see Drupal.orgâ€™s [Drupal 8 core Migrate module](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/core/modules/migrate-module) documentation.

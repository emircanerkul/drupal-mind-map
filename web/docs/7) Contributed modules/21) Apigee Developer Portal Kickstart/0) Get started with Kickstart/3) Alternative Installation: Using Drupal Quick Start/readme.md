Alternatively, you can use the composer `quick-start` script to run the [Drupal Quick Start Command](https://www.drupal.org/docs/installing-drupal/drupal-quick-start-command), as shown below:

`cd MY_PROJECTcomposer quick-start`

This command will install Drupal using PHP's built in web server and a SQLite database.

**Note:** While `quick-start` is the fastest means of installing this profile, it is not the most performant or complete. It does not present the configuration options available when installing via web browser. As a result, you'll need to configure the [Apigee Edge connection](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/modules/apigee-edge/configure-the-connection-to-apigee-edge) manually, post installation. See [Apigee Edge documentation](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/modules/apigee-edge) for more information.

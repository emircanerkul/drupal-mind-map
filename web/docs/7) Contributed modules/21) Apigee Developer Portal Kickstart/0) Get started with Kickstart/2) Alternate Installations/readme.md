You can always follow [standard Drupal install instructions](https://www.drupal.org/docs/installing-drupal) if you do not have an AMP stack (Web server, Database, and PHP), but here are some other ways to get an AMP stack up and running:

| **Drupal Quick Start** | Drupal Quick Start is a quick way to run Drupal with an embedded database and web server. See section below on details.                                                                                                                                                             |

| **Lando**              | Lando is a quick way to run the project on a local box, which uses Docker underneath the hood. This process also works for local development. See section below for details.                                                                                                        |
| **Docker**             | The [apigee/docker-apigee-drupal-kickstart](https://github.com/apigee/docker-apigee-drupal-kickstart) project on GitHub can help you quickly get Kickstart running on Docker.                                                                                                       |
| **Linux**              | This handbook has instructions named [Use Kickstart with Apigee Edge for Private Cloud](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/modules/apigee-developer-portal-kickstart/use-kickstart-with-apigee-edge-for-private-cloud) that can be used to get Kickstart working on a Linux environment. |

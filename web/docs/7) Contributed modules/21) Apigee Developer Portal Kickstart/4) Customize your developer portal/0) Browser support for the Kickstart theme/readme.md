In general, Drupal-based developer portals built using only [Drupal core](http://drupal.org/download) support the browsers listed in Drupal's [Browser requirements](https://www.drupal.org/docs/system-requirements/browser-requirements). However, the Kickstart distribution uses the Radix base theme (built on Bootstrap) and only supports browsers compatible with Bootstrap. For more details on browser support applicable to the Kickstart theme, see Bootstrap's documentation on supported [Browsers and devices](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/browsers-devices/).

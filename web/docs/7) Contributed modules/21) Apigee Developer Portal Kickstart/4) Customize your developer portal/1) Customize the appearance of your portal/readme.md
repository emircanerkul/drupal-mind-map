You can customize the color and text of your portal to match your company theme, add background images or update the logo. This section describes how to modify these elements.

### Change your color scheme

You can change the background and text colors of your site’s headers, footers and accents using the Apigee Kickstart **Customize** color picker.

To get started:

1. Log in to your portal as a user with admin or the "administer themes" permission.
2. Select **Customize** from the top level Drupal admin menu. Note that the **Customize** menu item will only be displayed while on the site pages, and will not be available when viewing admin pages. This will open the **Customize** sidebar, as shown in the figure below:

3. To change a header, footer, or accent color, click on the appropriate field. Then, enter the Hex color code or use the color picker to select your chosen color for the field. You will be able to preview your selection immediately on the current portal page.
4. Once you have selected your colors, click **Save configuration**. Your selections will be applied globally to your site’s headers, footers and accents.

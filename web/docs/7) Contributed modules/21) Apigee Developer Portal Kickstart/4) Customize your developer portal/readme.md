  The Apigee Developer Portal Kickstart installation profile includes a
  Kickstart theme with several preconfigured page entities loaded with starter
  content to get your site up and running quickly. However, there are many ways
  to customize the look and feel of your portal. Create a developer experience
  aligned with your brand: Change the color of links, backgrounds, text and
  other theme elements. Create new page layouts and content using the available
  entities and theme widgets. Personalize your developer experience by adding
  Forums, Blogs or FAQs for engagement with your developer community.

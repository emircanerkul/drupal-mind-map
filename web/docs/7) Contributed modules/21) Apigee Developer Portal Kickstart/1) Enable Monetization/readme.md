  The Apigee Developer Portal Kickstart provides the option to set up and
  customize Monetization features during site installation. If your Apigee Edge
  organization has Monetization enabled, the installer prompts you to enable
  Monetization in your portal. If your Apigee Edge organization does not have
  Monetization enabled at the time of Kickstart installation, you can install
  and enable the Monetization module later. Set up Monetization during Apigee
  Kickstart Site Installation (recommended) Follow the Installation instructions
  to install the Apigee Kickstart profile and set up your web server.

A forum container gives you a way to create a collection of forums. However a container is not a forum itself, it simply defines a collection of forums.

**To add a forum container:**

1. Log in to your portal as a user with admin or content creation privileges.
2. Select **Structure > Forums** in the Drupal menu to see the list of current forums.
3. Select **+Add** container.
4. Add information about the new container, including its parent if you want to nest it.
5. Select **Save**. This will open the **Forums** page.
6. On the **Forums** page, click and drag the plus sign, **+**, before a forum name to add it to your new container.
7. Click **Save**.

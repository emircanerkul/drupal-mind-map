As an administrator, you control the permissions required to perform actions on the blog, such as creating, editing, and deleting blog posts.

You also configure the permissions required to post, edit, and delete blog comments and whether a user's comment has to be moderated. If a comment does not have to be moderated, it appears immediately. If the comment has to be moderated, a portal user with the necessary permission to moderate comments must approve it.

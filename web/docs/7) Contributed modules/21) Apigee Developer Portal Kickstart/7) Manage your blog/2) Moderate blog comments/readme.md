Users of the developer portal can post comments to blog entries. By default, a user has to be logged in to the portal to post a comment. A users ability to view, post, edit, and approve comments depends on their role and permissions as described above.

**To moderate a blog comment**:

1. Log in to your portal as a user with admin or comment approval privileges.
2. Select **Content > Comments** in the Drupal administration menu.
3. Select either the **Published** comments link or the **Unapproved** comments link.
4. Use that page to moderate comments.

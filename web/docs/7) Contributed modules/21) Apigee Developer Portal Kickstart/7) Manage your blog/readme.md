  Your Kickstart portal enables users to create, edit, and delete blog posts.
  The blog page is made up of individual posts, each time stamped and displayed
  in descending order by date. Anyone, including anonymous users, can view the
  most recent blog entries by using the Blog navigation link provided in the
  main portal navigation. In addition, any user with the necessary privileges
  can comment on a blog post. Comments can appear as soon as they are entered,
  or you can configure the developer portal so that comments must be moderated
  before appearing.

When a user adds credit on a recurring billing schedule, a subscription (or temporary order) is created.

To view all subscriptions, go to **Commerce > Subscriptions**.

**Note**: For recurring subscriptions to work correctly with the payment gateway, ensure that your site's Cron is properly configured. For more information on configuration options, see [Cron automated tasks](https://www.drupal.org/docs/administering-a-drupal-site/cron-automated-tasks).

The appearance of the rate plan form and the way a developer purchases a rate plan differs slightly based on whether the portal is connected to an Apigee Edge, hybrid, or Apigee X organization.

For Apigee Edge-connected portals, developers purchase a rate plan by selecting **Purchase Plan** in the rate plan form, as shown below:

For Apigee X or hybrid-connected portals, developers purchase a rate plan by selecting **Purchase Product** in the rate plan form, as shown below:

For either rate plan display, you can perform the following tasks to configure rate plan settings:

* [Configure access to rate plan purchase form](#configure-access-to-rate-plan-purchase-form)
* [Manage fields displayed for a rate plan package](#manage-fields-package)
* [Manage fields displayed in the purchase rate plan form](#manage-fields-in-the-purchase-rate-plan-form)
* [Define the labels, text, and button names in rate plan forms](#define-the-labels-text-and-button-names-in-rate-plan-forms)
* [Update the display mode for rate plans](#update-the-display-mode-for-rate-plans)

**Note**: Some UI element names may vary if your developer portal is connected to an Apigee Edge, hybrid, or Apigee X monetized org. Variations are noted where applicable in the detailed instructions below.

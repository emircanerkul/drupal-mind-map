You can make it easy for developers to add credit to their prepaid balances using the Add Credit products from your store. If you created Add Credit products automatically using the "Requirements report" page in Step 3, the "Add Credit" button is automatically added to your prepaid balance page. You can skip to [Step 5: Configure permissions](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/modules/apigee-monetization/support-adding-credit-to-a-prepaid-balance#step-5-configure-permissions-for-developers) below.

If you manually created Add Credit products, follow these steps to add an Add Credit button to your portalâ€™s prepaid balance page:

1. Select **Configuration > Apigee Edge > Monetization > Prepaid Balance**.
2. Select the **Add credit** tab.
3. Create or edit an Add Credit product to enable adding credit to prepaid balances. One product must be added for each currency offered. If more than one currency is enabled for prepaid balances, make sure to add or configure a separate Add Credit product for each currency offered.  
   1. For each currency displayed, select a product from the autocomplete list.  
   2. To edit an Add Credit product that you previously added under the Commerce configuration, click the **edit** operation and make changes as needed.  
   3. If no Add Credit products are available, see [Step 3: Add products to the store](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/modules/apigee-monetization/support-adding-credit-to-a-prepaid-balance#step-3-add-products-to-the-store).  
   4. Click **Save Configuration**.  
   5. The Add Credit button will display on your prepaid balance page:

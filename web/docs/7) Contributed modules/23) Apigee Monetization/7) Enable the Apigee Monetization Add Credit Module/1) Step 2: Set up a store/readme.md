To enable prepaid developers to add credit to their balance and manage any orders, you need to set up a store. See also [Setting up your store](https://docs.drupalcommerce.org/commerce2/user-guide/setting-up-store) in the Drupal Commerce documentation.

To set up a store:

1. If necessary, add a new currency, as described in [Adding a currency](https://docs.drupalcommerce.org/commerce2/user-guide/setting-up-store/importing-currencies) in the Drupal Commerce documentation.
2. From the Drupal administration menu, select **Reports > Requirements report**.
3. Click **Setup store**.
4. Configure the store details, including name, email address for notifications, default currency, and mailing address.
5. Click **Submit**.

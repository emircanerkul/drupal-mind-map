When [registering an app](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/modules/apigee-edge/how-app-developers-interact-with-the-apigee-edge-module#registering-an-app), app developers will be able to use the following APIs only:

* APIs available via a purchased rate plan
* APIs available via a freemium plan
* APIs that are public and do not require that you purchase a rate plan

**Notes**:

* Before purchasing a rate plan, app developers will be prompted to view and accept the terms and conditions if they have not done so already. To add terms and conditions, see [Managing terms and conditions](https://docs.apigee.com/api-platform/monetization/specify-terms-and-conditions).
* You can configure the appearance of rate plans in the developer portal, as described in [Configure rate plan settings](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/modules/apigee-monetization/configure-rate-plan-settings).

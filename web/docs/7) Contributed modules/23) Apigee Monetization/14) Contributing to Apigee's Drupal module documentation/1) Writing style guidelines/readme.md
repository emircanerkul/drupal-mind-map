Our goal is make our Apigee module documentation clear and understandable. To do this, we rely on the [highlights](https://developers.google.com/style/highlights) and [general principles](https://developers.google.com/style/tone) of the Google Developer style guide and the Drupal.org [content style guide](https://www.drupal.org/drupalorg/style-guide/content).

Before drafting content to add to or update the Apigee Drupal module documentation, we suggest that you review the resources noted above. For your reference, a quick summary of important principles is provided below.

### Recommended tone and content

* DO use a friendly and helpful tone.
* DO aim for sentences that are clear, simple, and concise.
* DO write for a global audience. Try to avoid using idioms, slang, or humor that may not be understood by those outside your geographic region.
* DO try to avoid the use of industry jargon or buzzwords. Keep your language accessible to all users, including those new to the technology.
* DO NOT use phrases like _simply_, _It's that simple_, _It's easy_, or _quickly_ in a procedure.
* DO NOT use “please.” Use polite, clear language instead.

### Time-sensitive language

* DO NOT use “now” or “currently” or “new” to refer to a feature set or documentation addition. Avoiding time-sensitive language minimizes doc maintenance in the future.
* DO NOT announce a planned feature or describe a feature as “coming soon” unless your docs include a product roadmap. If possible, avoid making promises or giving hints about future developments.

### Grammar and word choice

* DO use the present tense if at all possible.  
 Ex: Use “This command starts the service” instead of “This command will start the service.”
* DO use an active voice to clarify who is performing the action.  
 Ex. Use “You can document your APIs with Apigee API Catalog” instead of “The APIs can be documented using Apigee API Catalog.”
* DO use “you” instead of “we” to address your reader, to avoid confusion as to the intended audience or actor.  
 Ex. Use “You can build a developer portal by...” instead of “We’ll create a developer portal by…”
* DO use standard American spelling and punctuation
* DO try to avoid starting all sentences with the same phrase (such as _You can_ or _To do_).

### Localization

* DO use unambiguous date formatting. This can be dates in full, or ISO date format.  
   * Ex: January 12, 2015  
   * Ex: yyyy-mm-dd

### Formatting

* DO use numbered lists for sequenced steps. For all other lists, use bulleted lists.
* DO precede lists with an introductory sentence or phrase ending in a colon.  
 Ex: With API Catalog, you can:  
   * Add a new API doc.  
   * Edit an API doc.  
   * Add an image and description to an API doc.
* DO consider tables for organizing and comparing items with similar attributes or multiple parameters.
* DO use serial commas.
* DO use bold text for UI elements including:  
   * Menu items  
   * Tab headings  
   * Buttons  
   * Icons
* DO put code related items in code font.
* DO Use sentence case for headings. Only capitalize the first word of the heading, except for proper nouns or acronyms.
* When using acronyms, make sure that the first use of the term is spelled out, with the acronym to follow.
* DO use only one space after a period.

### Use of images

* DO use SVG files or PNG images where possible.
* DO check for image responsiveness and size on various screens.
* DO add alt text to image tags to improve content for accessibility.

### Product Naming reference

* Apigee Edge module
* Apigee API Catalog module
* Apigee Monetization module
* Apigee Kickstart distribution
* Apigee Edge UI (or Edge UI)
* Apigee Edge APIs (or Edge APIs)
* Apigee hybrid

### Links and formatting

* Link text should be descriptive. If linking to another section, header or page, use the section, header or page title as your link text., if possible.
* Add class=”external” for links pointing to references outside of Drupal.org.  
   * If referring to external documentation, mention the organization responsible for the documentation.  
   * Adding target=”\_blank” is not necessary. Allow the user to decide whether or not to target a new page when opening a link.

  To configure the module settings visit the Settings page
  (admin/config/content/onlyone/settings), if you want to have the configured
  content types in a new menu entry named 'Add content (Only One)' you must
  check the option 'Show configured content types in a new menu entry?'. The new
  menu link will be available in the 'Content' page (admin/content) as an action
  link to the 'Add content (Only One)' page (onlyone/add), then the 'Add
  content' page (node/add) will show the not configured content types. For this,
  you need the Administer Only One permission.

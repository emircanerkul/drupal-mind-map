  Setting up a block style in a module with a PHP class Even more power is
  available if a custom plugin is created in PHP. Let's create a new "Sample
  Class" plugin which we will place in our module's /src/Plugin/BlockStyle/
  directory looking like /src/Plugin/BlockStyle/SampleClass.php. Create a new
  plugin class extending the BlockStyleBase class. Be sure to add in proper
  plugin Annotations such as: /** * Provides a 'SampleClass' block style for
  adding a class in a text field.

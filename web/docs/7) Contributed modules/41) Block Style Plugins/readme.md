  About Block Style Plugins is an API module that allows a module or theme to
  add style options to block configuration by creating a custom plugin. It is
  advisable to do this primarily in themes since the majority of styles should
  be specific to a theme. It allows you to define form fields on a block's
  configuration page which will apply classes to that block. These styles can
  also be restricted to only show on certain blocks so that editors aren't
  confused by options which shouldn't be available to them. Dependencies block

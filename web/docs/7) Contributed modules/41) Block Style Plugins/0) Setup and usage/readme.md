  Basic Setup Creating plugins and form fields in a Yaml file The easiest way to
  get started is to use a single yaml file to declare each plugin and the fields
  to display. This can go into either a module or better yet, a theme. Name it
  mymodule.blockstyle.yml or mytheme.blockstyle.yml replacing the first part
  with the name or your module or theme. sample_block_style: label: 'Sample
  Block Style' form: field_name: '#type': 'textfield' '#title': 'Add a custom
  css class' '#default_value': 'my-class' Notice: Form fields need to be on the
  same level and cannot currently be nested.

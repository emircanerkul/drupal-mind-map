  API Key Authentication is one of the simplest methods to protect Drupal REST
  APIs. Once you have generated API Keys for all your users, you can then use
  those keys to secure access to your Drupal REST APIs . You can do so by
  sending the userâ€™s Drupal username and API key in the Authorization header of
  your every API request. The Drupal REST & JSON API Authentication module will
  then authenticate the request based on the username and corresponding API key.

  JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open, standard way for you to represent your userâ€™s
  identity securely during a two-party interaction. This method of Drupal REST
  API Authentication module involves sending a JWT token along with your API for
  authentication. In this step, essentially, a username and password of your
  Drupal site are used to first get a JWT token. Once the username and password
  are verified, the Drupal REST API Authentication module will create a signed
  JSON Web Token. Then, the API will return that token back to the client
  application.

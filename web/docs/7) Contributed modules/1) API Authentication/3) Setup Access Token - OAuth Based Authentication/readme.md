description: >-
  OAuth (Open Authorization) is an open standard for token-based authentication
  and authorization protocol that can be used to provide single sign-on (SSO).
  OAuth allows particular information about an end user's account to be used by
  third-party services, such as Facebook, etc without exposing the user's
  password. It acts as an intermediary on behalf of the end user, providing the
  service with an access token that authorizes specific account information to
  be shared.

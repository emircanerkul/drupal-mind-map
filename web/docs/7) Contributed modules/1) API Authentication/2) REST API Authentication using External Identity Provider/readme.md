description: >-
  If you are looking to protect/restrict access to your Drupal REST APIs using
  your Identity provider, then you should go for the External Identity Provider
  Authentication method. Drupal API Authentication using an External Identity
  Provider involves the use of tokens received from third-party providers like
  Google, Azure AD, Keycloak, Okta, Gitlab, etc. for accessing Drupal rest APIs
  securely.

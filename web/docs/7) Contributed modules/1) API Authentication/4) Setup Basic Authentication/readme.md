  Basic Authentication is a very simple and straight-forward Authentication
  method. The client sends HTTP requests with an Authorization header that
  contains a base64-encoded username and password of your Drupal site. In Basic
  Authentication, the miniOrange REST API authentication module will first
  authenticate the user against their Drupal username and password and if the
  user is authenticated, only then the user will be able to perform that
  operation.

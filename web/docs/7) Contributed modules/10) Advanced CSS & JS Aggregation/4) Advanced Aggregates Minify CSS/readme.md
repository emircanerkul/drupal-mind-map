  OVERVIEW Minify CSS files using a 3rd party minifier; currently supports YUI
  (included) or the Core cleaning algorithm. YUI will lead to much smaller files
  sizes and is the recommended option - basically, if you aren't using it, you
  probably will get better performance without this sub-module enabled. The YUI
  Compressor included with Advanced Aggregates is slightly different from that
  found on GitHub (as of last check, one patch had not been applied to the
  GitHub version).

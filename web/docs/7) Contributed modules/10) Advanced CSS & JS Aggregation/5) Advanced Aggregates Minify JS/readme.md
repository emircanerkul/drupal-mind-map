  OVERVIEW Minify JavaScript files using a 3rd party minifier. AdvAgg includes a
  few and supports one faster compiled PHP extension. The options are: JSMin +:
  No installation required. Usually the second best minification, however it is
  the slowest supported option. JShrink: No installation required, JShrink is
  reliable and has fairly comparable minification to JSMin. JSqueeze: No
  installation required, JSqueeze provides the most effective minification and
  is the fallback if another minification method fails. It is still fairly slow.
  JSMin: The fast compiled C extension for PHP.

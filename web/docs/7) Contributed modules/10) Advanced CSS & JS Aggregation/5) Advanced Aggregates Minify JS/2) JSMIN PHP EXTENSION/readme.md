The AdvAgg Minify JavaScript module can take advantage of jsmin.c if it is available and selected as minifier. In that case, JavaScript parsing and minimizing will be done in C instead of PHP dramatically speeding up the process. The JsMin extension can be found at [GitHub](https://github.com/sqmk/pecl-jsmin). There are instructions on installing and compiling it there. Note that if you are using PHP 7.x you'll need to use the `feature/php7` branch rather than the `master` branch.

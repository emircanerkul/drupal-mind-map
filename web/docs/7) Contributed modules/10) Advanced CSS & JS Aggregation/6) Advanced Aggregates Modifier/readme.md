  OVERVIEW Depending on tweaks applied this module may cause compatibility
  issues with other modules. Includes additional tweaks that may not work for
  all sites such as: Force preprocessing for all CSS/JS. Add defer tag to all
  JS. Defer CSS loading using rel=preload and JavaScript Polyfill. Add async tag
  to all or only local JavaScript. Some of these may significantly increase
  performance depending on your individual site. However, they include possibly
  dangerous and minimally tested options so use care and read warnings on each
  option if there are any.

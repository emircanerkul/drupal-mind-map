  OVERVIEW This module may have conflicts with other modules if it is enabled.
  Includes additional functionality to improve Drupal compatibility with old
  versions of Internet Explorer (6-9). No currently known compatibility issues
  however due to method required to override core on this it is easily possible
  that there are other modules that do conflict. This module prevents CSS
  aggregates from being produced with more than 4095 (or a configured value)
  selectors as old Internet Explorer versions do not handle more than 4095
  selectors in an individual file.

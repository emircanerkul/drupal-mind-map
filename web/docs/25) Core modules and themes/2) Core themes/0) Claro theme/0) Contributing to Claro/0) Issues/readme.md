Claro is part of Drupal core now. Issues can be found in the [core's issue queue](https://www.drupal.org/project/issues/drupal?component=Claro+theme) filtering by Claro theme component. If this is your first time contributing to Claro, or it's a while since your last contribution, we recommend starting with an issue that is on this [list which has issues that are novice-friendly \[7 issues\]](https://www.drupal.org/project/issues/search/drupal?project%5Fissue%5Ffollowers=&status%5B%5D=Open&component%5B%5D=Claro+theme&issue%5Ftags%5Fop=%3D&issue%5Ftags=Novice).

Most of the team is focusing their work on stable blocking issues meaning that these issues are most likely to receive feedback from the maintainers and the rest of the team. Stable blocking issues can be found on the [Claro roadmap](https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/issues/3066007).

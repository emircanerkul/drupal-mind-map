### Buttons and Dropdowns

The main goal for buttons is to be easily identified as elements that can be clicked and interacted with. Several size variations also have been created to use in places with reduced space like tables.

### Form fields

Basic text field works as a base for the styles used in all form elements. The main goal is to keep the form elements simple with the minimal graphic elements needed to keep them discoverable, usable and accessible. Font size is being incremented for labels to 14px and to 16px for values following the modular scale.

Field design also takes into account different elements that can be placed on it such as counters, icons or errors. These are included in the style guide for future support.

### Selects

The select default style has been customized to fit in with the new design system and improve UX. We are aware this change could affect accessibility so that’s why we’ll make sure its implementation will keep selects accessible.

### Basic Form Controls

Form elements like checkboxes and radios follow the same visual guidelines as other form elements to keep the design consistent.

The style guide contains designs for each possible variation to keep accessibility in mind, even they may not be widely used.

### Tables

Tables have been designed to have high row height to accommodate large text sizes and adapt the color palette. The design uses icons for indicating when a column is sortable or sorted.

### Messages

The goal for the messages design is to reduce the amount of colors used and make sure there’s good color contrast by using the same styles the regular text has (link color, bold…). To do so, the color bridge has been widened to have enough color space to represent the warning level and to accommodate the icon. This solution works well for both small and long error messages.

### Tags or Entity reference

The implementation for this component is planned to have 2 phases. The first one will refresh the current field with the new field styles and will add a new throbber. A second phase will introduce a new component to represent entities inside fields.

### Breadcrumb and page title

The combination of the page title and the breadcrumb, together with the shortcut link, results in the header. The breadcrumb has been placed over the title to make it easier to find the current location in the application.

### Navigation list

The navigation pages on the admin UI has been designed with an emphasis on readability, and reusability of existing styles from other components.

### Details and accordions

This specific component will have several variations defined together with the main goal to unify all the related implementations by using similar properties and behaviors. For example, different implementations can be the html details, the accordion in the sidebar in a node form or the toolbar when it’s placed vertically.

All the variations will use the same directions for arrows (pointing right when collapsed, pointing bottom when opened) and the label for details is going to be 16px.

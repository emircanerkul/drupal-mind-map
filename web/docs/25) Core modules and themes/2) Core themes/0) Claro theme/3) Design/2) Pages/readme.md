To help you review and give feedback on the proposed visual styles in-use, weâ€™ve prepared several pages with the new designs implemented.

### Node edit form

As explained in previous sections, the changes on this first iteration will remain on a CSS level. In this page the perception change relies on the text size increment, the increased spacing, the element simplification and the lighter colors. This way, the content will get more relevance because only the focused, active or clickable elements are highlighted.

### Content list

This page works as an example to see the proposed design for tables. The text size increment, the row minimum height increment and the color palette keep the focus on the actionable or clickable elements on content on a busy UI. In this page the pager component is visible to see it working together with the table. Also, 2 different button sizes have been used.

### Admin forms

The 4 forms pages attached demonstrate several implementations of the designed components, using tables, details, tabs or fields. A component introduced here is the vertical tables in the Configure block. You can find attached the [Block Layout](https://www.drupal.org/files/issues/2018-12-03/page--block-layout.png), the [Configure Layout](https://www.drupal.org/files/issues/2018-12-03/page--configure-block.png), [Text formats and editors](https://www.drupal.org/files/issues/2018-12-03/page--textfformats.png) and [Cron](https://www.drupal.org/files/issues/2018-12-03/page--cron.png) forms.

### Typography

The base font size used on the style guide is 16px. For other font sizes, a modular scale is used to keep a good rhythm across the UI texts, but a small one that let us have enough font-size variations and hold hierarchy.

This style guide is designed to use system fonts which comes with various benefits, including improved performance and better support for various writing systems. Using system fonts will also make the UI feel like more familiar to the user since the look and feel will be closer to the users' environment.

### Color palette

This style guide is using a light color palette where the blue is vivid and greys are more neutral. The goal is to get a visually simple UI where important things like primary buttons stand out. This proposal evolves the 4 primary colors currently in Seven, and adds a wider range of greys.

### Iconography

Icons should be reduced to its minimal form, expressing essential characteristics to be interpreted. Avoid outlined versions of icons to keep the UI clean and simple. Icons with a packed or swamped interface with too many lines should be avoided also.

To preserve the hierarchy and proportions several standard sizes have been defined.

### Layers and surfaces

Spaces and elements will emulate physical qualities like depth and shadows to recreate an environment easier to understand and perceive.

### Spacing and sizing

Spaces and sizes like paddings, margins or icon sizes will be tied to the modular scale defined by the typography to help us shape the interface with a proper rhythm and balance to make layouts more predictable and scannable.

### Drupal Admin Design System

We created [a Design System](https://www.designbetter.co/design-systems-handbook) that defines a complete set of principles, patterns, and tools for building a coherent and user-friendly Drupal administrative user interface. It is defined by some standards (goals, principles and visual design language) and a visual interface library (components, patterns and animation).

### Basic principles

The design principles are based on [Drupal’s Values & Principles](https://www.drupal.org/about/values-and-principles) and we are adapting the original Seven’s style guide visual principles:

* **powerful:** confident, precise shapes and strong contrast, especially for user-controllable elements.
* **empathetic, responsive:** give emphasis to what matters; use hierarchy to explain the relation between elements; use predictable patterns; elements adapt and react to inputs.
* **clear, clean, concise:** define crisp lines and spaces, decisive shapes; avoid texture and ornamentation; each element should serve a clear purpose; make measured use of whitespace: room to breathe, but avoid sterility and emptiness.
* **accessible, transparent:** appeal to the greatest possible number of people; choose a legible typeface; set text for optimal readability; emphasize what matters; use consistent visual clues for affordances.
* **natural:** neutral tones; define continuity between spaces.
* **friendly, collaborative, democratic, respectful:** choose cheerful colours; avoid high contrast at large scales (too bold/aggressive); prefer well-known design patterns, iconography and affordances; avoid visual indulgence, ensure visual style is extensible and flexible.

### Accessibility

Complying with the latest accessibility standards is important. The designs have been built with previous feedback in mind and we have had several experts giving us feedback since the beginning of the project. If you are interested in providing us with some more accessibility feedback, we have an issue for that: [\[META\] Accessibility guidelines for Claro](https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/issues/3032981).

#### Focus state

To improve UX and Acessibility the focus style has been designed to aim for consistent focus indicator throughout the theme and components.

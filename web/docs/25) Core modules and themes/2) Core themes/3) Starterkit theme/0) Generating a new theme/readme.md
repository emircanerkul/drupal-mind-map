A new theme named `my_new_theme` can be generated by running the following command from the Drupal root:

```php
php core/scripts/drupal generate-theme my_new_theme
```

This will write the theme to the `themes/` directory by default.

Reference the help to see all configuration options:

```php
php core/scripts/drupal generate-theme --help
```

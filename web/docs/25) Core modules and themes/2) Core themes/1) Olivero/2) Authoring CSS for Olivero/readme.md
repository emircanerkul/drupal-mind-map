  Olivero uses PostCSS Preset ENV to transpile “modern” CSS into syntax that
  Drupal 9’s supported browsers (which includes IE11) can understand. PostCSS
  Present ENV is a “wrapper” PostCSS plugin that includes various other plugins
  which enable syntax that will hopefully become standard in native CSS. This
  includes things like custom media query variables, nesting, and transpilation
  of CSS variables, and logical properties.

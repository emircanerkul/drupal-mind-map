  Getting Involved Read this document (congrats, you’re already here!) Look
  through the Olivero theme component issues queue to see if any issues are not
  yet picked up. If you commit to an issue, comment on it, and let us know when
  you expect to post the work. Weekly meetings will be held every other Monday
  at 10 am ET (currently 2 pm UTC — but this will change when daylight savings
  goes away in the US) This meeting: • happens every other Monday at 3 pm GMT
  (10 am ET). • is chat only via the #olivero slack channel (no audio or video).
  • happens in threads so keep an eye on those notifications.

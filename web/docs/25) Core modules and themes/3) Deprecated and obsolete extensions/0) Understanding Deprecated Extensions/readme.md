Deprecated extensions are those that are currently provided in Drupal, but will be removed in a future version. These extensions can still be installed on a website, but it is important to note that they are likely to be removed in a future major release.

When this happens to core modules, the module may be moved to a separate contributed project. This means that the site owner will need to download or require the module separately with Composer at a future date.

The [Upgrade Status module](https://www.drupal.org/project/upgrade%5Fstatus) will show recommendations for dealing with deprecated modules for your site, as well as assessing your readiness to update to a new major release more generally.

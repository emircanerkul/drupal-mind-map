Currently, since Drupal 9.4.x and 9.5.x still supply the deprecated modules that are removed in Drupal 10, installing a contributed module that has a dependency on a deprecated core module will _not_ install the contributed version of that module as a dependency. If you specifically want to use the contributed version of the module, you should explicitly require it with `composer require`. Closer to the Drupal 10 release, this may change so that composer ignores the core version of the module and always installs the contributed version when it's pulled in as a dependency.

When installing the contributed version of a removed core module, always check the available versions and composer instructions on the contributed module project pages. For example, the HAL module has separate branches for Drupal 9 and Drupal 10 compatibility.

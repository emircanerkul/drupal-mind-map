Drupal Components are independent libraries that do not depend on the rest of Drupal in order to function. Components MAY depend on other Drupal Components or external libraries/packages, but MUST NOT depend on any other Drupal code. In the Drupal source code tree, these components can be found under the /drupal/core/lib/Drupal/Component folder. 

The table below shows each of the 25 Components of Drupal 9.3 (which have a total of approximately 120 classes). Each Component name is linked to the code in the Drupal repository. To give a general idea of the complexity of a given Component, the Classes column shows the approximate total number of classes for each Component. In parentheses are the approximate number of Standard classes (S), Plugin derived classes (P), Exception classes (E), Final classes (F), and Abstract classes (A). The table also shows the number of Interface classes and Traits in the Component along with a link to further Drupal or Symfony documentation as applicable.

| Component for parsing front matter from a source. Front matter is used as a way to provide additional static data associated with a source without affecting the contents of the source. Typically this is used in templates to denote special handling or categorization. Front matter must be the first thing in the source and must take the form of valid YAML set in between triple-hyphen lines. |                      |            |        |                                                                                                       |

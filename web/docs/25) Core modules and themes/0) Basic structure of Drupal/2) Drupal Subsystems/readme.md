Code in the Drupal\\Core namespace represents Drupal Subsystems provided by the base system. These subsystems MAY depend on Drupal Components and other Subsystems, but MAY NOT depend on any code in a module. In the Drupal source code tree, these subsystems can be found under the /drupal/core/lib/Drupal/Core folder. 

The table below shows each of the 77 Subsystems of Drupal 9.3 (which have a total of approximately 1172 classes). The Subsystem name is linked to the code in the Drupal repository. To give a general idea of the complexity of a given Subsystem, the Classes column shows the approximate total number of classes for the given Subsystem. In parentheses is the approximate number of Standard classes (S), Plugin derived classes (P), Exception classes (E), Final classes (F), and Abstract classes (A). The table also shows the number of Interface classes and Traits in the Subsystem along with a link to further Drupal documentation as applicable.

| Ajax is the process of dynamically updating parts of a page's HTML based on data from the server. When a specified event takes place, a PHP callback is triggered, which performs server-side logic and may return updated markup or JavaScript commands to run. After the return, the browser runs the JavaScript or updates the markup on the fly, with no full page refresh necessary.                                                                                                                                                                                              |                             |            |                                                                                                                             |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| Building on the [Annotation Component](#ComponentAnnotation), this provides annotations for class discovery and metadata description. The Drupal plugin system has a set of reusable components that developers can use, override, and extend in their modules. Most of the plugins use annotations, which let classes register themselves as plugins and describe their metadata. (Annotations can also be used for other purposes, though at the moment, Drupal only uses them for the plugin system.)                                                                               |                             |            |                                                                                                                             |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| Batch functions allow forms processing to be spread out over several page requests, thus ensuring that the processing does not get interrupted because of a PHP timeout, while allowing the user to receive feedback on the progress of the ongoing operations. The API is primarily designed to integrate nicely with the Form API workflow, but can also be used by non-Form API scripts (like update.php) or even simple page callbacks.                                                                                                                                            |                             |            |                                                                                                                             |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| Blocks in Drupal 8 are made up of two separate API structures: the Block Plugin API and the Block Entity API. The Block Plugin API is a stand-alone reusable API and the Block Entity API addresses use cases for block placement and visibility control.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |                             |            |                                                                                                                             |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| The configuration API provides a central place for modules to store configuration data. This data can be simple configuration like your site name, or more complex information managed with configuration entities, such as views and content types. Configuration is a place to store information that you would want to synchronize from development to production. This information is often created during site-building and is not typically generated by regular users during normal site operation.                                                                             |                             |            |                                                                                                                             |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| Drupal's database abstraction layer provides a unified database query API that can query different underlying databases. It is built upon PHP's PDO (PHP Data Objects) database API, and inherits much of its syntax and semantics. Besides providing a unified API for database queries, the database abstraction layer also provides a structured way to construct complex queries, and it protects the database by using good security practices.                                                                                                                                   |                             |            |                                                                                                                             |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| The association of a path with a controller, coupled with parameter upcasting and access checking, is handled in the routing system. This system serves as a basis for path access on a Drupal site. The Drupal menu system is a collection of different APIs for menu items defined by modules as well as local tasks, actions and contextual links.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |                             |            |                                                                                                                             |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| The Drupal Plugin API allows a module or subsystem to provide functionality (plugin instances) in an object-oriented way. Plugins that perform similar functionality are of the same plugin type. Module developers write plugins to extend various systems like blocks, field widgets, and image effects and add new options for administrators to choose from.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                             |            |                                                                                                                             |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| Drupal's Render API roughly consists of two parts: (1) the render pipeline — which is format-agnostic (HTML, JSON, anything) and (2) render arrays, which are a representation of a HTML page. They allow nesting (like HTML) and altering (necessary for Drupal's flexibility).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                             |            |                                                                                                                             |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| A route is a path which is defined for Drupal to return some sort of content on. For example, the default front page is a route. When Drupal receives a request, it tries to match the requested path to a route it knows about. If the route is found, then the route's definition is used to return content. Otherwise, Drupal returns a 404\. Drupal 8's routing system is heavily based on Symfony's. Drupal's routing system can do everything Symfony's can (and more), and both use the same syntax to define routes.                                                           |                             |            |                                                                                                                             |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| The State API is simple system for the storage of information about the system's state.

| When you include text in code, and the text will be displayed in the Drupal user interface, it needs to be internationalized (prepared properly) so that it can be localized (translated), so that users can make Drupal sites that are completely displayed in different languages. In Drupal, all interface text must use English as its default language. Also, the project uses automatic mechanisms to extract translatable text strings from the code base, so that translation teams can use Drupal translations to translate the text of Drupal Core and contributed projects. |                             |            |                                                                                                                             |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

The Typed Data API provides developers a consistent way of interacting with data and also provides means of fetching metadata about the actual data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                             |            |                                                                                                                             |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| Entity validation is a separate Entity validation API that is decoupled from form validation. Decoupling entity validation from forms allows validation entities to be independent of form submissions, such as when changed via the RESTful web service. The validation API implementation is based on the Symfony validator.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |                             |            |                                                                                                                             |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

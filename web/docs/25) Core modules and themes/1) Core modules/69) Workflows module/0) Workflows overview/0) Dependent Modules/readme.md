* [Content Moderation](/docs/8/core/modules/content-moderation) is a core module that harnesses the Workflows module to allow revisionable content entities to move between different moderation states.
* [Workflows Field](/project/workflows%5Ffield) is a contributed module that allows for generic state transitions, but is unconcerned with publishing (unlike Content Moderation).

  The Content Moderation module allows you to expand on Drupal's "unpublished"
  and "published" states for content. It allows you to have a published version
  that is live, but have a separate working copy that is undergoing review
  before it is published. This is achieved by using Workflows to apply different
  states and transitions to entities as needed. Configuration Enabling the
  Content Moderation module creates a default Workflow called "Editorial" that
  can be used for custom block types or content types.

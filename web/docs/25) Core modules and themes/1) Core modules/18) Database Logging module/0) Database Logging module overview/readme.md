  About The Drupal core module Database logging monitors your system, capturing
  system events in a log to be reviewed by an authorized individual at a later
  time. This module was previously called Watchdog in D4, & D5. This is useful
  for site administrators who want a quick overview of activities on their site.
  The logs also record the sequence of events, so it can be useful for debugging
  site errors. The log is a list of recorded events containing usage data,
  performance data, errors, warnings and operational information.

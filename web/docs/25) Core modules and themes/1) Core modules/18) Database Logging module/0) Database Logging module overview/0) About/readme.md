The Drupal core module _Database logging_ monitors your system, capturing system events in a log to be reviewed by an authorized individual at a later time.

This module was previously called _[Watchdog](/documentation/modules/watchdog)_ in D4, & D5.

This is useful for site administrators who want a quick overview of activities on their site. The logs also record the sequence of events, so it can be useful for debugging site errors.

The log is a list of recorded events containing usage data, performance data, errors, warnings and operational information. Administrators should check the Drupal core report on a regular basis to ensure their site is working properly.

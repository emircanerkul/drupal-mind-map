  About The Syslog module logs events by sending messages to the logging
  facility of your web server's operating system. Syslog is an operating system
  administrative logging tool that provides valuable information for use in
  system management and security auditing. Most suited to medium and large
  sites, Syslog provides filtering tools that allow messages to be routed by
  type and severity. It is not suitable for shared hosting environments. It
  might not be as user friendly as Database Logging but will allow you to see
  logs and troubleshoot if your site is not accessible.

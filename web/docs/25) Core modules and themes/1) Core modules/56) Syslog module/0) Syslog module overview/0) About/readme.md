The Syslog module logs events by sending messages to the logging facility of your web server's operating system. Syslog is an operating system administrative logging tool that provides valuable information for use in system management and security auditing. Most suited to medium and large sites, Syslog provides filtering tools that allow messages to be routed by type and severity.

It is not suitable for shared hosting environments.

It might not be as user friendly as Database Logging but will allow you to see logs and troubleshoot if your site is not accessible. Since the Database Logging module writes logs to the database, it can slow down the website. By using Syslog, you can potentially improve the performance of the implicated site.

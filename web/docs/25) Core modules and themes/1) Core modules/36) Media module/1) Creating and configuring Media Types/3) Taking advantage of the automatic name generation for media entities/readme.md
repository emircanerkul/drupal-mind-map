As with any entity in drupal, all media entities need to have a human-readable label attached to each instance created. The Media module automatically creates a base-field for this, called "**Name**".

If you want your editors to be able to input/edit this value manually on each entity, you don't need to do anything, aside from probably configuring some of the field widget settings on the form, such as textfield size, placeholder, etc. These settings can be configured at the URL: `admin/structure/media/manage/{media-type-machine-name}/form-display`

On the other hand, if you do not want to expose this to be created/modified for each entity, the module provides an "**automatic label**" functionality. This actually happens each time a media entity is being saved without a manual value introduced. In order to take advantage of this, just **disable/hide** the name field from the entity form configuration (on the same URL indicated above), and your entities will be created with a default name/label.

Note that _each type provider (media source plugin) is requested to provide a sensible default name_, according to each source characteristics. For example, the "**image**" type provider will probably provide a default name based on the image **filename**, or the "**twitter**" source will provide a default name based on the tweet's author/tweet ID.

If the source provider does not indicate any type-specific name to be used as default **and** a media entity is created without name, the Media module will use the following pattern as a fallback: `media:{media_type_machine_name}:{uuid}`.

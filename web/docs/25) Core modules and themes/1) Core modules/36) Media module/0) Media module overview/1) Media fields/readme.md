The [Media Library](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/core/modules/media-library-module) module provides a user interface to allow content creators to easily find and use existing media items that improves the UX of Media reference fields.

<!-- note-warning -->
> WARNING: The core Media module is a result of porting most of the media_entity, media_entity_document, and media_entity_image from contrib. The ecosystem is still in the process of standardizing on the core Media module's media entities instead of those provided by the media_entity module. When working with contributed modules make sure to verify their compatibility with the core Media module.

  Build tools CKEditor plugins are created via a build process. In the /core
  directory, first install dependencies: yarn install Changes can be built from
  source code with: yarn build:ckeditor5 Trigger the build process any time a
  source file changes: yarn watch:ckeditor5 Installing CKEditor 5 from source
  For development, it can be useful to be able to pull a specific commit from
  the CKEditor 5 repository instead of a tagged release. This could be useful
  for testing future releases, or finding commit that caused a regression.

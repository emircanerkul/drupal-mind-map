As is the case with many modern JavaScript libraries, CKEditor 5 plugins use a build process that compiles source files into the application consumed by the browser. The [CKEditor 5 Dev Tools module](https://www.drupal.org/project/ckeditor5%5Fdev) provides a starter template in the `/ckeditor5_plugin_starter_template` directory. We highly recommend beginning CKEditor 5 plugin development with this template, as all the necessary tooling is preconfigured, as are the steps specific to it working in Drupal.

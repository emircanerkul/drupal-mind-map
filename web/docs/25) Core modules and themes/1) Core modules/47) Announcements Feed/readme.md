> WARNING: The Announce module has not yet been committed to Drupal core. Work is in progress in #3206643: Project messaging channel in core (as experimental) 

Announce module provides a feed of Drupal project and Drupal Association announcements in Drupal core.

Provides an interface as part of the administrator toolbar for viewing announcements from the Drupal project. The list of announcements is provided from drupal.org and may provide information about upcoming releases, new feature highlights, events like DrupalCon, and promote support of the project via Association membership or other programs. It was originally developed as [the Announce contributed module](https://www.drupal.org/project/announce).

There are no settings in the module, the drupal.org source feed location is built-in. Users may configure which user roles have access to the announcement list in the toolbar.

The Announce module sources it's content from: <https://www.drupal.org/about/announcements>

These announcements include a semver version constraint parameter, so that if the post is of interest only to users on a particular version or range of versions it can be displayed just to them. 

Subject to the governance policy, content can be added to this feed by: 

* Being posted directly to: <https://www.drupal.org/about/announcements>
* Being cross-posted from another source, such as the Drupal core blog: <https://www.drupal.org/about/core/blog>

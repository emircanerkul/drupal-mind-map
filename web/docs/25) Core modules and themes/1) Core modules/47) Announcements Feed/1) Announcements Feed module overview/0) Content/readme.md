The purpose of this feed is to provide a channel for outreach directly to Drupal site owners. This content must be highly relevant to site owners interests, serve the strategic goals of the project, and/or promote the sustainability of the project and the Drupal Association. 

Only the title, teaser and date information are displayed directly in the Drupal UI, and these teasers link to the full content on Drupal.org. 

#### Featured content

Featured content is sticky to the top of the announcements feed, and is given more visual weight by including teaser text and different styling. Featured content is reserved for posts that are of special importance or are time sensitive. Such content might include highlights about upcoming features in the next major version of Drupal, migration and support options for users still on legacy versions, or time sensitive communications from the project or the Drupal Association. 

#### Regular content

Regular content is displayed in order of publication date and given less visual weight, with no teaser text. Regular content must still be of particular importance to site owners, but less so than featured items. This content might include important information about features or changes in a minor version of Drupal, surveys for end-user input, or information about DrupalCon and Drupal Association membership.

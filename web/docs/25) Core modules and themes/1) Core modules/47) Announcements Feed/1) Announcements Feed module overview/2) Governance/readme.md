Governance of the announcements feed follows a similar principle to other Drupal contribution: the author of the post cannot 'RTBC' the work. 

This announcement feed is jointly governed by Drupal core maintainers and the Drupal Association. 

* If the Drupal Association drafts a post, at least one member of the core maintainer team must approve it.
* If the Drupal core team drafts a post, at least one member of the Drupal Association must approve it.
* If the Drupal Association and Drupal core team cannot reach consensus, the Project Lead will decide.

  This page assumes familiarity with the Layout Default concepts in Creating
  Layout Defaults. Layout Overrides in Layout Builder Layout Defaults are
  layouts that apply to all nodes/entities of a given content type/bundle.
  Layout Overrides make it possible to override the Layout Default and create a
  custom layout for that entity. Once a Layout is overridden on an entity, that
  entity will not be impacted by changes to Layout Defaults. Layout Overrides
  are not enabled by default.

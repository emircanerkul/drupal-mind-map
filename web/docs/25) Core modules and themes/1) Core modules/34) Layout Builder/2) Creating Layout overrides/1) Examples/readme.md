### Creating a Layout Override for an Article Node.

Clicking the "Layout" local task will take you to the Layout Builder user interface (UI). Any changes made on this layout will only impact the specific node. Once the Layout Override is saved, the node will no longer be impacted by changes to the Layout Defaults for its content type.

The "Discard changes" button will discard all in-progress changes in the override and replace with the layout of the most-recently-saved version of the Layout Override.

The "Revert to defaults" button removes the override, reverting the node to use the Layout Defaults.

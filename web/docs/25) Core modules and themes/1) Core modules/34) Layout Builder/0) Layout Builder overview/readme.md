Drupal's Layout Builder allows content editors and site builders to create visual layouts for displaying content. Users can customize how content is arranged on a single page, across types of content, or even create custom landing pages with an easy to use drag-and-drop interface.

Layout Builder offers a visual design tool for the following use cases:

1. **Layouts for content.** The creation of "layout templates" that will be used to layout all instances of a specific content type (e.g. blog posts, product pages). Replaces the default "Manage display" feature for determining what fields, and what field formatters, are shown, with a more powerful tool that can also place blocks in addition to fields.
2. **Customizations to templated layouts.** The ability to override these layout templates on a case-by-case basis (e.g. the ability to override the layout of a standardized product page for one specific product).

The Layout Builder provides the ability to drag and drop site-wide blocks and content fields into regions within a given layout. Additionally, custom "inline" blocks can be created for one-off details specific to a given layout.

Note that Layout Builder is not turned on by default in Drupal.

For more information, see:

* [Creating Layout Defaults](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/core/modules/layout-builder/creating-layout-defaults) covers how to set up a default layout template that is used for all content of a given type
* [Creating Layout Overrides](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/core/modules/layout-builder/creating-layout-overrides) covers how to create layouts and one-off pages that digress from the uniform template.

For developers/site builders, Layout Builder provides layout building utility for managing the display of all fieldable entities on a site.

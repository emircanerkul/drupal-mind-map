Once the Layout Builder module has been enabled. The UI for building a default layout that will be used for all content items of a specific entity + bundle combination (e.g all nodes of the type article) is accessed by going to the entity/bundle’s display options and pressing the “Manage Layout” button.

If an entity + bundle combination is configured to allow overriding the default layout the UI for overriding the layout for a specific entity is available via the “Layout” local task.

When the Layout Builder UI is first accessed, the Page Layout will default to displaying the entity fields in the same order they would be displayed without Layout Builder enabled.

  Accessing the Layout Builder UI Once the Layout Builder module has been
  enabled. The UI for building a default layout that will be used for all
  content items of a specific entity + bundle combination (e.g all nodes of the
  type article) is accessed by going to the entity/bundle’s display options and
  pressing the “Manage Layout” button. If an entity + bundle combination is
  configured to allow overriding the default layout the UI for overriding the
  layout for a specific entity is available via the “Layout” local task.

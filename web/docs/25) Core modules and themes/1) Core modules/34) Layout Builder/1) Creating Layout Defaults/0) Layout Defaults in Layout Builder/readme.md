Layout Defaults are Page Layouts that will be used as long as no [layout overrides](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/core/modules/layout-builder/creating-layout-overrides) exist. The specificity of the layout will depend on the piece of content it's applied to:

* Some entity types, such as Content Types and Vocabularies, have "sub-types" attached (known as "bundles" under the hood) (e.g. "Articles" or "Blog posts" in the case of Content types; "Tags" or "Categories" in the case of Vocabularies). In this case, default layouts apply to all content of that specific sub-type (e.g. a layout default for Article applies to all Articles on the site, but not to Blog posts).
* Other entity types do not have sub-types, such as Users. In this case, layouts will apply across the board, unless otherwise overridden.
* Layout defaults are also applied on a "per-view-mode" basis (a view mode specifies a different context in which a piece of content may be displayed, such as Search results or Teaser). This means Layout Builder can be used on some but not others, and that different view modes can use different Layout Defaults - for example the “Teaser” view mode for a content type can use a different Layout Default from its default view mode.

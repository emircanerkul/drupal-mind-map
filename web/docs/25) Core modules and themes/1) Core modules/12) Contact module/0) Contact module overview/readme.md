  The Contact module allows site visitors to send emails to other authenticated
  users and to the site administrator. Uses Through personal contact forms,
  users can send one another an e-mail. And through site-wide contact forms,
  users can send e-mail to arbitrary email addresses, such as the site
  maintainers. With either form, users can specify a subject, write their
  message, and also have a copy of their e-mail sent to their own address.
  Through contact forms, users allow themselves to be contacted yet keep their
  own e-mail addresses private until the message is replied to.

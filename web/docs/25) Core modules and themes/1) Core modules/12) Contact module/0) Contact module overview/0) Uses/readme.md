Through _personal contact forms_, users can send one another an e-mail. And through _site-wide contact forms_, users can send e-mail to arbitrary email addresses, such as the site maintainers.

With either form, users can specify a subject, write their message, and also have a copy of their e-mail sent to their own address. Through contact forms, users allow themselves to be contacted yet keep their own e-mail addresses private until the message is replied to. As an administrator, you can enable or disable the contact module altogether.

As a user, you can also enable or disable your personal contact form if that option has been provided. When the form is enabled, a _contact_ tab is displayed in your user profile, for everyone to see. (Privileged users such as site administrators can contact users who have turned their forms off, as they can access their user account email addresses.) When you visit your own profile, the contact tab is not displayed. However, it is displayed to other users (if it has been enabled).

~~You can set up "categories" for the site-wide contact form, to allow for multiple recipient options. For example, one category might be "website feedback," and another might be "product information." For each category, you can specify one or more email addresses to which the form will be sent. You can also specify whether the user will receive an automatic reply.~~  
You can create several separate contact forms for different categories.

You can specify the text to display on your site-wide contact page and you can optionally limit how many times a user can submit a contact form in an hour.

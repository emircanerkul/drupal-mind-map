  Field module is an internal developer API. For information about using Fields
  with your Drupal site, see Field UI module. The Field module allows custom
  data fields to be attached to Drupal entities (content nodes, users, taxonomy
  vocabularies, etc.) and takes care of storing, loading, editing, and rendering
  field data. Most users will not interact with the Field module directly, but
  will instead use the Field UI module user interface. Module developers can use
  the Field API to make new entities "fieldable" and allow fields to be attached
  to their entities.

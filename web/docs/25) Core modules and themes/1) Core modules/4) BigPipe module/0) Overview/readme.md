The BigPipe module is included in [Drupal 8 core](/project/drupal) **since Drupal 8.1**. It made a step towards becoming non-experimental in **Drupal 8.2**: instead of an _alpha_ it became marked as a **_beta_**. And it became **stable in Drupal 8.3!**

The [BigPipe technique](https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-engineering/bigpipe-pipelining-web-pages-for-high-performance/389414033919) was invented at Facebook.

It is strongly recommended to also enable the [Dynamic Page Cache](/documentation/modules/dynamic%5Fpage%5Fcache) module that is included with Drupal 8 core.

BigPipe demonstration

### How it works

1. During rendering, the personalized parts are turned into placeholders.
2. By default, Drupal 8 uses the Single Flush strategy (aka "traditional") for replacing the placeholders. i.e. we don't send a response until we've replaced all placeholders.
3. The BigPipe module introduces a new strategy, that allows us to flush the initial page first, and then _stream_ the replacements for the placeholders.
4. This results in hugely improved front-end/perceived performance (watch the 40-second screencast above).

### Features

**Faster with zero configuration!** BigPipe is able to make things faster automatically thanks to Drupal 8's improved render pipeline & render API, and in particular thanks to the cacheability metadata and auto-placeholdering.

### Ensuring a smooth visual page load experience

Because BigPipe lazily loads certain parts of the page, it _could_ result in a jarring page load experience. Whether it _does_ depends on your theme and the location of the lazily loaded content: in the demonstration screencast above, there is no jarring experience at all because the streamed/lazily loaded blocks appear one after the other, appending to an otherwise empty space.

That's the simplest solution: have the lazily loaded content appear in a space that is reserved for them, that avoids [reflowing](https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/browser-reflow) content.

But that's not always possible. In that case, you'll want to apply the patch for the currently proposed ["interface previews" feature](https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/issues/2632750) to let your theme define a _preview of the interface that will be populated by BigPipe_, using a Twig template. 

Alternatively, you can apply a "loading" animation to _all_ BigPipe placeholders in your theme with some CSS â€” read ["Quick Tip: Add a Loading Animation for BigPipe Content"](https://www.lullabot.com/articles/quick-tip-add-a-loading-animation-for-bigpipe-content).

### Relation to Page Cache & Dynamic Page Cache modules in Drupal 8 core

* Page Cache (`page_cache`): no relation to BigPipe.
* Dynamic Page Cache (`dynamic_page_cache`): if a page is cached in the Dynamic Page Cache, BigPipe is able to send the main content much faster. It contains exactly the things that BigPipe still needs to do

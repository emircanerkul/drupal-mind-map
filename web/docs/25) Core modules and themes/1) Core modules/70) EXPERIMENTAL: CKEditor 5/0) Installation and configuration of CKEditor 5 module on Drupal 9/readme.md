  CKEditor 5 is included in Drupal 9.3 as an experimental module. To use it,
  install it and switch existing text formats to use CKEditor 5. Text formats
  that were using CKEditor 4 will automatically get equivalent configuration
  generated for them, including a similarly configured toolbar. Text formats
  that were not using CKEditor before (no text editor at all or a non-CKEditor
  one) will also get an approximate toolbar generated for them, if they have
  HTML restrictions configured in their filters.

  The CKEditor 5 experimental module is available in Drupal 9.3 and Drupal 9.4.
  As of Drupal 9.5 the CKEditor 5 module is stable. CKEditor 4 was added to core
  in Drupal 8. It is a stable project but will stop being supported sometime in
  2023, around the same time as Drupal 9's end of life. Replacing CKEditor with
  the new and very much improved CKEditor 5 is part of the Drupal 10 readiness
  initiative. Developed as a contributed project initially, CKEditor 5 is the
  default since Drupal 9.5.0.

Out of the box, there are two layouts of the administrative media library: table-style and grid-style. The table-style view is useful for displaying media items with additional information, which may be preferable for lists of documents or audio files, for example:

The grid-style view gives you a visual depiction of each media item with minimal textual information, which is well-suited to browsing images, for example:

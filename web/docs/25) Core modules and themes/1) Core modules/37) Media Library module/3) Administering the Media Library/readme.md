  The Media Library module adds a simple and customizable grid-style view of
  your media entities to the media administration page (/admin/content/media).
  The existing table-style view provided by the Media module is shown by
  default, but the addition of the grid-style view in the tab sub-menu allows
  you to toggle between the two styles. These administrative displays can be
  customized using the Views module and by customizing the view modes of your
  media items. The grid-style view is part of the "Media Library" view, and the
  table-style view is part of the "Media" view.

The Media Library module adds a simple and customizable grid-style view of your media entities to the media administration page (/admin/content/media). The existing table-style view provided by the Media module is shown by default, but the addition of the grid-style view in the tab sub-menu allows you to toggle between the two styles.

These administrative displays can be customized using the Views module and by [customizing the view modes of your media items](#). The grid-style view is part of the "Media Library" view, and the table-style view is part of the "Media" view. See the [Views module documentation](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/core/modules/views) for more information about working with views.

Like nodes, media items can be managed in bulk by selecting multiple items and applying actions, such as delete or unpublish, using the drop-down menu. Several filters are also provided to help find specific media items in the library.

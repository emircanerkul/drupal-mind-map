The 'Media library' form display is responsible for the insert dialog. Adding newly created fields to the 'Media library' form display makes them appear when clicking insert on node. For example: admin/structure/media/manage/image/form-display/media\_library.

(Rem.: You need to enable custom settings for the "Media library" form mode before you can add fields to that form mode. Just going to "Manage form display" won't do it -- that's the settings for the _default_ form mode, not the media library. However, that page should have a collapsible area, at the bottom of the page, to enable custom settings for other form modes. One of those checkboxes should be "Media library". If you ensure that box is checked, then save settings, you should be able to configure the "Media library" form mode, which _will_ affect what fields show up in the media library.)

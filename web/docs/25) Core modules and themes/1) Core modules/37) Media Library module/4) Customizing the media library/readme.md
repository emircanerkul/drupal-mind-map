  The core of the media library is the collection of media items for you to
  choose from. It can be displayed in two ways: as a grid or as a table. Both
  layouts are part of the same view, creatively named "Media library", and both
  are totally customizable with the Views module. However, it's worth noting
  that the grid layout is intentionally sparse, and meant to be very "visual",
  with minimal textual information. The table layout is far more suitable for
  displaying additional fields and metadata if needed. See the Views module
  documentation for more information about working with views.

![Parts of the media library, in tabbing order, numbered 1 through 6.](https://www.drupal.org/files/3083968-02.jpg)

1. The media library is divided up by media type, and these vertical tabs filter items in the library by type. Which media types, and therefore which tabs, are available can vary depending on site configuration. If you select items on a given tab, then switch to another tab, your prior selections are remembered.
2. If you have appropriate permissions, this area allows you to add media items to the media library (it does not appear if you don't have permission). Exactly which field(s) will be present in this area can vary by media type and site configuration.
3. Here you can search for particular media items in the library, or apply various filters to the available items. These filters are part of the "Media library" view, and can be customized as described in "Customizing the media library", below.
4. The media library can be displayed in two ways: as a grid or as a table. These icons allow you to switch between the two layouts. Any selections you make in the grid layout will be remembered in the table layout, and vice versa.
5. This is the current set of media items available to you, with filters and/or search terms applied. The media library works a little bit like a shopping cart; clicking the checkbox for any given item will add it to your selection, and you can click the "Insert selected" button to "check out" and add the selected items to a field or text editor.
6. This counter keeps track of how many media items you have selected so far, across all types. Depending on site configuration, there may be a limit to the number of items you can select, in which case the counter will say something like "3 of 10 items selected". (If there is no limit, the counter will simply say something like "2 items selected".)

If you have the appropriate permission, you'll be able to add media to the media library by using the small form directly above the grid (or table) of media items (note that this form does not appear at all if you don't have permission to add media):

When you add media to the library, you will see an interstitial form to fill out additional information. Exactly what information you will need to provide varies by site configuration and by the type of media you're adding. You will at least need to fill out any required fields associated with that media type; if you're adding an image, you will also need to provide alternative text for screen readers. (Some media types, such as YouTube videos, don't require any additional information at all by default.)

If you had previously chosen items from the media library before you started adding new items, those selections will be remembered; you can see them in the "Additional selected media" area.

When you have finished entering required information, you have two choices:

* **Save and select** will save the new media item(s) into the library, then return to it so you can select more items.
* **Save and insert** will save your new media item(s) and insert them, along with any prior selections, directly into the field or text editor from which you opened the media library.

Getting started with Media Library couldn't be any easier. Simply visit the Extend page of the administrative interface, and install the "Media Library" module from the "Core" group. That's all!

From here, there are two ways to use the Media Library: [via an entity reference field](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/core/modules/media-library-module/the-media-library-field-widget), or [in a WYSIWYG text editor](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/core/modules/media-library-module/embedding-media-with-ckeditor).

You can enable, disable, duplicate and delete a view.

1. Navigate to **admin/structure/views**
2. In the **Operations** column beside a view, select one of the following options:  
   * **Enable** \- The view can be displayed to authorized users.  
   * **Disable** \- A disabled view cannot be displayed.  
   * **Edit** \- You can change any of the View settings.  
   * **Duplicate** \- You will be prompted to name the duplicated view. You can also change any of the settings for the duplicated view.  
   * **Delete** \- A deleted view cannot be recovered
3. Click **Save Configuration**.

You can do some of these from within a single view using the drop down located at the upper right of the Views Displays table (just above the Advanced link.)

For any changes you make be sure to review that View's or Display's Access setting. It's too easy to allow unauthorized users to see data they should not. See <https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/core/modules/views/add-a-display-to-a-view>

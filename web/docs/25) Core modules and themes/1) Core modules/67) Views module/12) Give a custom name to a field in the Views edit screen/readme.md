  Sometimes a view can use the same field in several different ways. To avoid
  confusion on the Views Edit screen, you can give each use of the field a
  different name. Navigate to the edit screen for a view (for example,
  admin/structure/views/view/MYVIEWNAME/edit). In the FIELDS section, click an
  existing field or Add a new field. The Configure Field dialog box displays.
  Ensure the Create a label field is checked. Enter a name for the field in the
  Label text field.

Sometimes a view can use the same field in several different ways. To avoid confusion on the Views Edit screen, you can give each use of the field a different name.

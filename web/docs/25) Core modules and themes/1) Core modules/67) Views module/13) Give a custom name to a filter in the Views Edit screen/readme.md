  Sometimes a view can use the same filter in several different ways. To avoid
  confusion on the Views Edit screen, you can give each use of the filter a
  different name. Navigate to the edit screen for a view (for example,
  admin/structure/views/view/MYVIEWNAME/edit). In the Filters section, click a
  filter or Add a new filter. The Configure Filter dialog box displays. In the
  Label field, enter a name for the filter. This name will be displayed in the
  Views Edit screen as well as provide a label for the filter in the rendered
  view. Leave the Label field blank to remove the label.

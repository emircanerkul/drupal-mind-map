The Toolbar and Shortcuts bar can both be disabled by disabling their associated module via the Modules administration page (_Manage > Extend_  or `http://example.com/admin/modules`).

If the toolbar is disabled, you can reach the administrative screens directly by going to `http://example.com/admin`.

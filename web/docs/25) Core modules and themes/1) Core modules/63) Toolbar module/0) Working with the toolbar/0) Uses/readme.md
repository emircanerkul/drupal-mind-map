### Shortcuts bar

When you select the _Shortcuts_ menu, you will see a white bar below the Toolbar with a customizable list of shortcuts. Click "edit shortcuts" on the right side to add to the default shortcuts.

You can customize different sets of shortcuts on the Shortcuts administration page (_Administer > Configuration > User interface > Shortcuts_ or `http://example.com/admin/config/user-interface/shortcut/`). Each set of shortcuts is its own list of custom links, and each user can select which set they would like to see on their user profile.

The shortcut set that is selected can also be displayed as a block in any region, by adding the Shortcuts block to a region on the Blocks administration page (_Administer > Structure > Block Layout_ or `http://example.com/admin/structure/block`).

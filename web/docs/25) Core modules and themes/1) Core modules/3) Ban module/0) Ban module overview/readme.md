  The Ban module allows administrators to ban visits to their site from
  individual IP addresses. It is included in core in Drupal 8 and later. In
  Drupal 7, the Ban functionality was part of the System module in Drupal core,
  rather than being a separate module. The Ban module is not enabled by default
  in the Standard profile, so you'll need to go to your "Extend" page and enable
  it. To ban an IP address Navigate to /admin/config/people/ban. Enter an IP
  address (for example, 10.0.0.1). Click Add. Note Drupal will prevent you from
  banning your own IP address.

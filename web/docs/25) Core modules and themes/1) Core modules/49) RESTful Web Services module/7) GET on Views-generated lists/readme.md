  The REST export display plugin uses the Serializer to output lists of entities
  in different formats (JSON, XML, ...). NOTE: The REST export plugin does not
  use the REST resource plugin. The permissions defined by REST do not apply to
  Views. Setup Ensure that the REST and Serialization modules are enabled.
  Create a view and add a REST export display. Make sure to add a path to the
  display. You'll be using this path to access the JSON/XML data. Enable data
  formats (JSON, XML, ...) in the Serializer format settings.

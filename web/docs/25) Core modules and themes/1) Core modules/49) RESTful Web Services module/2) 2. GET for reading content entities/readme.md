  Configuration See Getting started: REST configuration & REST request
  fundamentals â€” Configuration Sample requests below assume this configuration:
  resources: entity:node: GET: supported_formats: - hal_json supported_auth: -
  basic_auth - cookie NOTE: latest versions of Drupal 8 (at time of writing
  8.9.x) don't have hal_json format available just json. Thus you need to
  substitute json wherever you see hal_json below. Test with a GET request You
  can use many clients to test requests.

**First read [RESTful Web Services API — Practical](/developing/api/8/rest#practical).**

Now you know how to:

1. Expose data as REST resources.
2. Grant the necessary permissions.
3. Customize a REST resource's formats (JSON, XML, HAL+JSON, CSV …).
4. Customize a REST resource's authentication mechanisms (cookie, OAuth, OAuth 2.0 Token Bearer, HTTP Basic Authentication …)

Armed with that knowledge, you can configure a Drupal 8 site to expose data to precisely match your needs.

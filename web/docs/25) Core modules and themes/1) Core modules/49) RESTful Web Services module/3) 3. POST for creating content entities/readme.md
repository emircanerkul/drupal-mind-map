  Configuration This builds upon the GET example of the previous page. See
  Getting started: REST configuration & REST request fundamentals â€”
  Configuration Sample requests below assume this configuration: resources:
  entity:node: GET: supported_formats: - hal_json supported_auth: - basic_auth -
  cookie POST: supported_formats: - hal_json supported_auth: - basic_auth -
  cookie NOTE: latest versions of Drupal 8 (at time of writing 8.9.x) don't have
  hal_json format available just json. Thus you need to substitute json wherever
  you see hal_json below.

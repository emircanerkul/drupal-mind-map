  The Statistics module has changed since Drupal 7. It now only shows you how
  often a given page is viewed, and when it was viewed. There is no information
  anymore about who viewed it or the previous page the user visited (referrer
  URL). The statistics are useful in determining how users are visiting and
  navigating your site. It provides a customisable "Popular content" block that
  can be added to your theme. Use Configuring statistics In Drupal 9, configure
  statistics via Configuration > System > Statistics.

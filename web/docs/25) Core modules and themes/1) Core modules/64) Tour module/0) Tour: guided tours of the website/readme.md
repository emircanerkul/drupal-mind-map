  The Tour module is included in Drupal core. When enabled, the Tour module
  provides guided tours of the site interface via tooltips. To take a Tour, edit
  an existing View at /admin/structure/views and click the "? Tour"-link in the
  upper right-hand corner in the admin tooolbar. Alternatively, visit
  /admin/structure/views/view/frontpage?tour=1 to auto-start the Views tour.
  Tours can be used to: draw users' attention to critical components of the
  interface, especially those elements that might not be immediately obvious,
  guide the user through a workflow.

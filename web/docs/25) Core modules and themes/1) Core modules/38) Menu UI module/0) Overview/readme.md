  You can add, remove and rename menus and menu items/tabs. You can also
  configure a special block for a menu and you can specify the default menu to
  which new items will be added. In many themes, there are at least two menus,
  the Main (or primary) menu, and a secondary menu. The Main menu's links drive
  the main navigation structure for your site and are often displayed
  prominently across the top or side of the site. The Secondary menu is often
  used for items like the copyright and privacy notices and is often displayed
  at the bottom or very top of the page in smaller text.

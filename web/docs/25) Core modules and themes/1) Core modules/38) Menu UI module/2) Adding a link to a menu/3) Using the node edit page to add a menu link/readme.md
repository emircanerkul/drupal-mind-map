1. Navigate to the node editing screen (_Node > Edit_ or `http://example.com/node/*/edit`) for the node you want to add to the menu (this is in the Content menu for Drupal 7). This can also be done when you first create the node.
2. Click the checkbox marked **Provide a menu link** in the Menu Settings tab. The menu options will appear.
3. In the **Menu link title** field, enter the title as it will be displayed in the menu.
4. In the **Description** field, enter the text that will be displayed when a user hovers over the link.
5. In the **Parent item** list, choose the menu that should display this item. Note: the menu you want will only appear in this list if you have assigned it to the content type of the node you are editing. See "Before you begin" above.
6. (Optional) In the **Weight** list, select the relative weight of the link.
7. Click **Save**.

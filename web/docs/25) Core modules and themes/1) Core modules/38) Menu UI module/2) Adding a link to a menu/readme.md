  Before you begin Ensure that the Menus module is activated. If the link you
  plan to add leads to a Drupal node, first be sure your menu is enabled in the
  node's content type. It is possible to add menu links that are not enabled in
  the content type using the first method below. If you do, you will find that
  certain changes can cause your link to disappear from the assigned menu.
  Adding a link directly into the Menu Navigate to the Menus page (Structure >
  Menus or http://example.com/admin/structure/menu). Locate a menu to edit and
  click add link.

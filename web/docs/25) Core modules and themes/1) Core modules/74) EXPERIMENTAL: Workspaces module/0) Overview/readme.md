  What is a workspace? A workspace is a copy of the live site, that exists in
  parallel to the live site. Use a workspace when you want to prepare multiple
  new content items, that you want to go live at the same time, in a controlled
  manner. A typical scenario can look like this:
published_time: '2016-11-01T14:12:38+00:00'
modified_time: '2020-10-15T10:28:44+00:00'

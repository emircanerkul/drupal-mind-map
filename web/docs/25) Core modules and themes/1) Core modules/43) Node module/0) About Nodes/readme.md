  All content on a Drupal website is stored and treated as "nodes". A node is
  any piece of individual content, such as a page, poll, article, forum topic,
  or a blog entry. Comments are not stored as nodes but are always connected to
  one. Treating all content as nodes allows the flexibility to create new types
  of content. It also allows you to painlessly apply new features or changes to
  all content of one type. Behind the scenes, the Node module manages these
  nodes. This module lets you: List, sort through, and manage all the content on
  your site. Set defaults for how all posts are displayed.

All content on a Drupal website is stored and treated as "nodes". A node is any piece of individual content, such as a page, poll, article, forum topic, or a blog entry. Comments are not stored as nodes but are always connected to one. Treating all content as nodes allows the flexibility to create new types of content. It also allows you to painlessly apply new features or changes to all content of one type.

**Behind the scenes, the Node module manages these nodes. This module lets you:**

1. List, sort through, and manage all the content on your site.
2. Set defaults for how all posts are displayed.
3. List and configure the "content types" for your site, and create new ones.

The ability to create different "content types" is a way Drupal allows you to have different kinds of nodes for different purposes. For example, an "article" is one content type, a "book page" is another, and a "blog entry" yet another. You can also create new content types of your own.

The Node module manages the creation, editing, deletion, settings, and display of the main site content. Content items managed by the Node module are typically displayed as pages on your site, and include a title, some meta-data (author, creation time, content type, etc.), and optional fields containing text or other data. 

Each node has an [unique ID](https://www.drupal.org/node/624494).

  In Drupal 8 and later, the History module is included in Drupal core. When
  enabled, the History module records which user has read which content. This
  only applies to authenticated users. Entities older than 1 month will always
  be shown as "read". There is no UI provided, but history data is exposed to
  the Views module. You can add history data with the "Has new content" field to
  show "new" or "updated" node marks. You can also use the "Has new content"
  filter to only show content that is new or updated. Dependencies Node Issue

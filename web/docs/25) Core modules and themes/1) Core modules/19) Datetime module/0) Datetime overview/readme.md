  About The Datetime module provides a Date field that stores dates and times.
  It also provides the Form API elements datetime and datelist which other
  modules can make use of. See the Field module documentation and the Field UI
  module documentation pages for general information on fields and how to create
  and manage them. For how to make use of the Form API elements in modules you
  program yourself, see the Form API documentation and the Form and render
  elements API reference documentation.

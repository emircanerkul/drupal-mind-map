  This section contains examples and information per request type: GET, POST,
  PATCH and DELETE About the examples All examples are working examples that you
  can try either in a browser or a JSON client (for example: Postman). You need
  a standard Drupal installation, a number of Article nodes and the JSON:API
  module enabled. http://example.com/jsonapi/node/article/{{article_uuid}} All
  requests use the '/jsonapi' path prefix, which is the default value of the
  JSON:API module. In various examples placeholders are denoted by a double
  curly brace syntax, eg. {{...}}.

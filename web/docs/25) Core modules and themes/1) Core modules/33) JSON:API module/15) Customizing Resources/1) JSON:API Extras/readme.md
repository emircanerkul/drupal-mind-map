Some of this functionality is also supplied in [JSON:API Extras](https://www.drupal.org/project/jsonapi%5Fextras). This module tries to use the core functionality where possible but supplies an interface and some extra features like:

1. Altering the basepath to the API.
2. Add enhancers to fields.
3. Disable resources by default.

After enabling the module you can visit **/admin/config/services/jsonapi** to see a list of all configuration and content exposed by JSON:API.

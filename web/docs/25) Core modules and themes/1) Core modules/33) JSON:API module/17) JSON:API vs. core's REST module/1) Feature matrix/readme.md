| Zero configuration                             | [✔️](http://jsonapi.org/implementations/)                  | REST: each @RestResource plugin definition is available to be exposed, but must be configured to be exposed. For each, you must select the allowed formats, allowed authentication providers and optionally even allowed HTTP methods. JSON:API: all entities are exposed automatically, entity/field access is respected, all installed authentication providers are allowed automatically. |                                                                                                                     |

  TL;DR Choose REST if you have non-entity data you want to expose. In all other
  cases, choose JSON:API. Slightly more nuanced: Core's REST module allows for
  anything (any format, any logic, any HTTP method) and extreme configurability.
  Powerful but complex and hence relatively brittle. JSON:API focuses on
  exposing Drupal's biggest strength (entities/data modeling) in a coherent
  manner. Simple yet sufficiently powerful for most use cases. Feature matrix
  High-level feature-based comparison between JSON:API and REST.

  The Drupal core JSON:API module implements the JSON:API spec for Drupal
  entities. It provides a zero-configuration required, opinionated, way to allow
  RESTful CRUD for a Drupal site's content. It is closely coupled to Drupal's
  Entity and Field APIs, response caching, and authentication and authorization
  systems. Because it follows the shared JSON:API conventions it can help
  increase productivity and allow you to take advantage of non-Drupal specific
  tooling. Read more about the architecture of the module.

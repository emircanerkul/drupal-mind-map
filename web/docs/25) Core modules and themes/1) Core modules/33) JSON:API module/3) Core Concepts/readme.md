  JSON:API has many concepts in the specification, not all of which are
  documented here. However, users of the module do not need to completely
  understand all of the concepts of the specification to become productive with
  this module. If you would like to go deeper into how JSON:API's documents are
  structured, why the module does something in one way or another, or just would
  like to learn more about the module's design, readers are encouraged to read
  the specification on jsonapi.org.

JSON:API has many concepts in the specification, not all of which are documented here. However, users of the module do _not_ need to completely understand all of the concepts of the specification to become productive with this module. If you _would_ like to go deeper into how JSON:API's documents are structured, why the module does something in one way or another, or just would like to learn more about the module's design, readers are encouraged to read the specification on [jsonapi.org](http://jsonapi.org/format/).

  The Actions UI module provides tasks that can be executed by the website such
  as unpublishing content, sending an email, or banning a user. Other modules
  can fire these actions when certain system events happen; for example, when a
  new post is added or when a user logs in. Modules may also provide additional
  actions. Actions UI is a core module in Drupal 8 and later. To configure
  Actions, navigate to /admin/config/system/actions. There are two types of
  Actions: simple and advanced. Simple Actions do not require any additional
  configuration and are listed here automatically.

To configure Actions, navigate to **/admin/config/system/actions**.

There are two types of Actions: simple and advanced. Simple Actions do not require any additional configuration and are listed here automatically. Advanced Actions need to be created and configured before they can be used because they have options that need to be specified; for example, sending an e-mail to a specified address or unpublishing content containing certain words.

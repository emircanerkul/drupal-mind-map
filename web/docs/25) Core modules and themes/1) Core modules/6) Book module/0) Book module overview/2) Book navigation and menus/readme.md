When users visit your site and view a book page, they see links at the bottom for navigating from the parent page to the first child page, and from the previous page to the next page. A link labeled Up leads back to the parent page in the book structure. A link to a printer-friendly version of the page is at the bottom, for users with the permission to view printer-friendly versions of pages.

The Book module automatically generates a contents page for each book. However, if the books on your site are complex, you may find that you need additional navigational aids beyond the table of contents and the previous/next/uplinks for users to understand where they are in your book. One navigational aid you can use, is the book navigation block, which you could enable on the [Block Layout](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/core/modules/block/overview) page. Enabling this block turns on a menu that shows, where the user is in your book; the menu is only visible when viewing the book. An example is the menu of this documentation, which is created by the book navigation block.  
If this block is not available after installing or activating the module, you should refresh the sites cache. Check also for translation of the blocks name, if your language is different from English.

To extend this menu to show its children and grandchildren, look into the [Book Tree Menu](https://www.drupal.org/project/book%5Ftree%5Fmenu), but which is not covered by the [security advisory policy](https://www.drupal.org/security-advisory-policy) and which requires at least a Bootstrap theme (which one is not clear). **Use at your own risk!** It may have publicly disclosed vulnerabilities. The [Custom Book Block](https://www.drupal.org/project/custom%5Fbook%5Fblock) module was created as an alternative that does not require Bootstrap, and has opted into security coverage for stable releases.

The Outline tab appears for users who have permission to add node to books. Also, when editing a node that can be added to a book, an Outline section appears. You can use either to put a node into a book. (As of Drupal 8.6 the Outline tab was buggy when creating a new book.)

### Creating a book

To create a book, edit a node of a content type that can be added to books. Add the node to a new book:

1. On the page, click _Edit_
2. On the edit form, open the Book Outline section
3. Set the Book drop-down to _Create a new book_
4. Save the page

Drupal creates a new book with the name of the node you added. 

### Adding a page to a book

Use the same system to add a page to an existing book, using either the Outline tab or the Outline section of the node edit form.

To add the page as a sub-page of any existing page (for example a page within a chapter), set the Parent Item to the page below which you want your new page to appear in the hierarchy. 

### Modifying the order of pages in books

When adding or editing a page that is in a book, you can change the parent Item and change the weight, which controls the order of the pages under the parent. Pages with lower weight appear before page with higher weight (for example, 1 appears before 2 and -1 appears before 0).

Alternatively, reorder pages on the book listing. Choose _Structure >> Books_ to see a list of the existing books. Click on the _Edit Order And Titles_ button for the book you want to edit, drag the pages into the structure and order you want, click on _Save Book Pages_ to save the changes.

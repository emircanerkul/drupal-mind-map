description: >-
  A book is a set of pages tied together in a hierarchical sequence, perhaps
  with chapters, sections, and subsections. You can use books for manuals, site
  resource guides, Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs), or curricula. Any content
  type can be added to a book, and a book can contain nodes of more than one
  content type. The Book module is a core module and is not enabled by default.
  It must be enabled on the Manage >> Extend page, which lists modules. Users
  who have permission can create a book and write, review, modify, or rearrange
  the pages.

A _book_ is a set of pages tied together in a hierarchical sequence, perhaps with chapters, sections, and subsections. You can use books for manuals, site resource guides, Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs), or curricula. Any content type can be added to a book, and a book can contain nodes of more than one content type.

The Book module is a _core_ module and is not enabled by default. It must be enabled on the **Manage >> Extend** page, which lists modules.

Users who have permission can create a book and write, review, modify, or rearrange the pages. Many users can work together on a book; you can allow or disallow collaboration, to whatever extent you want. You can't manage different rights for different books by default. The standard Drupal installation allows you only to define rights or permissions for the content type, not for nodes or node trees.

Choose **Structure >> Books** and click the Settings tab to control:

* which content types are allowed to be added to books
* which content type will be created when a user clicks the "Add child page" link when they are viewing a node in a book

You can enable one or many content types to be in the book. All books have the same set of enabled content types.

Control who can create, edit, and maintain book pages by choosing **Manage >> People >> Permissions** and scrolling down to the Book section.

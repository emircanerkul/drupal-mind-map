If you create a new book and choose to not publish it, the book will not appear in the list of books and you will not have the option to add child pages to your first book page. Effectively you have to publish the first page to start adding child pages. If you want to create a book structure without making it public until it is edited and vetted, use a role based access module or similar to let you publish the book, so you can add child pages, but hide it from the public until ready for publication. See [this issue](https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/issues/26552) for work in progress to address this.

When you reorder book pages, the new order will be reflected immediately in the Book navigation block (8.4.1-dev). However, you have to clear the cache before the new order will be reflected in the content area.

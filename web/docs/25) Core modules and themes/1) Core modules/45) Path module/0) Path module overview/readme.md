  The core Path module lets you optionally create URL aliases for your Drupal
  pages. By default, Drupal automatically creates web addresses like
  http://www.example.com/?q=node/67, which are not user- or search
  engine-friendly. Search engines will give better rankings to pages that have
  more human-friendly URLs, especially if they include relevant keywords - for
  instance, http://www.example.com/?q=all-about-tarantulas. Uses As an
  administrator you can : Set the path for an individual node with the Path
  module (on the node/add or node edit form).

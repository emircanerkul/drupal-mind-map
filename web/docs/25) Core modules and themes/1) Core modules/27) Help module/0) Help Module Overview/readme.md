  The Core Help Module supports Drupal's built-in help system. Its Help landing
  page appears by default in the administrative GUI of a site. (Do not confuse
  Core Help with the contributed Help Module. The latter has nothing to do with
  Drupal's help system.) Core Help Landing Page The core Help landing page
  provides an overview (like a table of contents), of all enabled modules in a
  site, for which Help is available. The image here contains a sample of such
  overview.

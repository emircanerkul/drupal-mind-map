  As a rule of thumb, websites built using just Drupal core (i.e. with no
  additional, contributed modules) are compatible with, and fully functional in,
  all modern browsers that support CSS and JavaScript (with minor variations in
  appearance). Drupal only guarantees support for the list of supported
  browsers.

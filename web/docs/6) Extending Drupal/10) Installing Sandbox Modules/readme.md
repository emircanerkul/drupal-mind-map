  In addition to the contrib modules which have been through the project review
  process, there are less rigorously vetted modules known as sandbox modules.
  These modules are not covered by the Drupal security check process and are not
  packaged for download. Sandbox modules tend not to be as widely used as
  contrib modules. They may be incomplete and may not have good support. On the
  other hand, some of them are quite good and merely need reviewers to get them
  through the project application review process.

Sandbox modules tend not to be as widely used as contrib modules. They may be incomplete and may not have good support. On the other hand, some of them are quite good and merely need reviewers to get them through the [project application review process](https://www.drupal.org/project/projectapplications "Drupal.org security advisory coverage applications | Drupal.org").

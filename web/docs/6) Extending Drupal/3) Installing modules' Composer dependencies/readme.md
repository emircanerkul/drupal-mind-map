  Composer is the PHP package manager. It provides features similar to Drupal's
  own dependency management, and Drush make, but for any project, not just
  Drupal modules. Many modules for Drupal 8 or higher depend on generic PHP
  packages that need to be included in a site's codebase using Composer. Which
  modules have Composer dependencies? There are a few ways to tell if a module
  has Composer dependencies: It documents the facts on its project page or in
  its README or INSTALL files. Its root directory contains a composer.json file.

  This documentation guide describes extending your Drupal site beyond the
  capabilities of a standard Drupal core installation. You can pick and choose
  from a wide range of contributed modules to add functionality to your site,
  and from a wide range of contributed themes to change your site's appearance.
  These add-on modules and themes are also known as “contrib” because they were
  contributed by members of our Drupal community, and are available on
  Drupal.org free of charge.

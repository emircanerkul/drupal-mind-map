### **Using the Drupal User Interface (easy):**

1. Navigate to the _Extend_ page (admin/modules) via the Manage administrative menu
2. Locate the module(s) you wish to enable and check the box next to each one
3. Click Install to enable (turn on) the new module(s)

### **Or use the command line (advanced, but very efficient).**

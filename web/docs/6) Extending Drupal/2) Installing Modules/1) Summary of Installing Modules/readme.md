You start by [Adding ](https://www.drupal.org/docs/extending-drupal/installing-drupal-modules)a module then immediately Enable it (/admin/modules) to make it work then set Permissions (/admin/people/permissions) to allow people to use it, and [Configure ](https://www.drupal.org/docs/configuration-management)it (location varies by module as described on its page). These steps are separated for security.

As time passes, you [Update](https://www.drupal.org/docs/extending-drupal/updating-modules) modules (/admin/modules/update) regularly for security and functions. If you don't need a module, you can't just disable it as in Drupal 7, but you need to [Uninstall ](https://www.drupal.org/docs/extending-drupal/uninstalling-modules)it (/admin/modules/uninstall) (or [this](https://www.drupal.org/docs/user%5Fguide/en/config-uninstall.html)). **Note**: This will also remove the configuration. Finally you can remove the module folder, which is not required, but keeps your site clean.

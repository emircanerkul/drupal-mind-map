  To search for contributed modules, go to Download and Extend page As you can
  see there are many search options, but the most important is Work with. Set it
  to the Drupal version you want to find modules or themes for. Feel free to
  change any of the other search items. You can also put a keyword or two in the
  text area box for 'Search modules'. The item 'Sort by' is, by default, set on
  "Most installed", which means that the search results will be sorted by the
  most popular first.

To search for contributed modules, go to [Download and Extend](https://www.drupal.org/project/project%5Fmodule) page

As you can see there are many search options, but the most important is **Work with**. Set it to the Drupal version you want to find modules or themes for. Feel free to change any of the other search items. You can also put a keyword or two in the text area box for 'Search modules'. The item 'Sort by' is, by default, set on "Most installed", which means that the search results will be sorted by the most popular first.

On the search results page, the 'name' of each module (or theme) is a link to its home-page, known at drupal.org as its project page.

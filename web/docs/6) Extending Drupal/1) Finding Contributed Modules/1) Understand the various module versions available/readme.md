On the "project" page, see the section 'Releases'. Here each version of the project is listed with information about the version of Drupal it is compatible with, testing results, and links to the production and development versions.

### Version information

The version number and the release date are the first item listed for a version. For projects compatible with Drupal 7 the version number will begin with '7'. For projects compatible with Drupal 8 or higher the first number does not indicate the Drupal version it is compatible with. In all cases, the version of Drupal the project is compatible with is on line 'Requires Drupal: '.

The version you choose must be compatible with the version of Drupal you are using.

For more information about the version numbering scheme that is being used, read [What do version numbers mean on contributed modules and themes?.](/docs/8/understanding-drupal-version-numbers/what-do-version-numbers-mean-on-contributed-modules-and)

### Recommended releases

A recommended release is indicated with a check mark and the text 'Recommended by the project's maintainer' and a background green color.

### Other releases

If no 'Recommended releases' is available, your next best option is to try another release, if available.

Non recommended releases are generally on their way to becoming a 'Recommended releases' version.

But, on the other hand, on a rare occasion, an older version is an older stable version of the module before major changes were made to it. In that somewhat rare case, the older stable version will have been moved from the 'recommended releases' when the newer version was ready. One reason for keeping an older version around would be if some other separate module projects were dependent on the older version for that dependent module to work properly.

### Development releases

The 'Development releases' version of the module is in some stage of development. It is the current 'state of the art of development' version, as the developers are working out bugs, or are adding new features.

Module project pages vary in depth of detail, however, because the content of each project page is created by one of the module's developers.

**The project page is usually worth reading carefully.**

Among other things, if the module is dependent on another module(s), or possibly an extra 'library'(s), that information will be posted. It is not critical if you forget about a module or library dependency, however, because later when you try to enable or use the module, you will get a notice about what you are missing.

### 'Releases' section

If the project has a release this section provides information on the various versions that are available for that module.

### 'Issues for...':

The module's project page will always include links under the heading 'Issues for...'. Those links are in the right-hand column when your browser window is wide enough, or they are near the page bottom under the 'Downloads' and 'Maintainers for...' sections when your browser window is narrower.

The 'Issues for...' links take you to the issues queue for that specific module project. The issues queue is the official place where all of the problems ('Bug report'), support requests, ('Support request') and new-feature requests ('Feature request') can be found and searched for.

So, if you run into problems with a module, search the module's issue queue. If your problem (or request) has not already been addressed, post your question or issue using the link 'Create a new issue', and someone will try to help you out.

### Resources:

Just under the 'Issues...' section, in the section under the heading 'Resources', I always look for the link 'Read documentation'. That link will not always exist, but if it is there, it is a link to what the project's developers consider the most useful information for their project.

The 'Read documentation' link might take you to a page on drupal.org in the 'Documentation' section, or the link might take you to a page off of the drupal.org site.

Generally speaking though, every contrib module will have a "README.txt" file and/or an "INSTALL.txt" file in its top-level folder that you can view after you download the module, or after you import it into your site.

The various Documentation resources available for a module (or theme) are discussed elsewhere. For now, note that you can view any project's 'README.txt' file, or see its other documentation without downloading anything, by following the instructions below in the 'Module documentation and help'

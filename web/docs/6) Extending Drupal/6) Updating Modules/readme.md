  Most contributed modules will receive periodic updates that fix security
  issues, fix issues with the module's functionality, add new features, or all
  three. It's a good idea to regularly check for new versions of the module's
  you're using and update them when newer versions are released. The process of
  updating a module is very well described in the User Guide - read chapter
  13.6: "Updating A Module". If you are using Composer to manage your site, read
  3.5. Using Composer to Download and Update Files.

Several different mobile web application toolkits exist, with varying degrees of support for smartphones, tablets, and feature phones. The two general approaches to building a mobile web application toolkit are to work from HTML5/CSS (jQuery Mobile, jQTouch), and to work from Javascript (Sencha Touch, Enyo). The HTML5/CSS toolkits are somewhat easier to adapt to Drupal. The Javascript frameworks don't integrate with Drupal at the theming layer, so the process for development is similar to building a native mobile app.

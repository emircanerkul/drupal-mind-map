Simple navigation menus lend themselves to larger display platforms (laptops) as well as smaller displays (smartphones). In general, drop down menus are not often used on smaller displays (smartphones) since visual space is limited.

Usually, you find drop-down menus converted to stacked vertical lists when the display detected is a smartphone.

### Possible Solutions

A common method to provide a more sophisticated menu system for both large and small displays is to use conditional menu blocks. Be aware that complex, lengthy menus do not lend themselves to small displays.

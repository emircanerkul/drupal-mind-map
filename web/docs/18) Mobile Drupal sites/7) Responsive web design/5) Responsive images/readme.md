Jason Grisby has an excellent series of posts on the problems of responsive images: <http://blog.cloudfour.com/responsive-imgs/>

Jeremy Keith’s [two golden rules](http://adactio.com/journal/4997) for dealing with responsive images:

1. The small image should be the default.
2. Don’t load multiple images.

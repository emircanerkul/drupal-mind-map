Building a native mobile application gives you two things that mobile web applications don't provide - distribution through mobile app stores and access to native functionality. Some things you can get with a native mobile application are:

* Ability to charge for app in Google Play or App Store
* In-app purchase and subscriptions through the App Store, Google Play, or other app stores
* In-app advertising from native mobile app networks
* Access to the device's camera to take images or video
* Access to the device's file system for caching
* Access to the device's contacts
* Access to the device's accelerometer, gyroscope, compass, and map
* Native map functionality
* Background location awareness (starting with iOS 5)
* Image filters (such as sepia, halftone, etc.) (starting with iOS 5)

Many of these things will be available to mobile web applications in the future, but native mobile applications are the only way to get many of these things right now.

#### UPDATE Nov 2021

At the end of 2021, an low-cost alternative to deliver native apps experiences are the **Progressive Web Apps (PWA)**. They provide a subset of the native apps functionalities: look&feel, push notifications, offline work, device hardware access, etc. The good news is the existence of a Drupal module ([Progressive Web App](https://www.drupal.org/project/pwa)) that easily injects the PWA features into your Drupal site.

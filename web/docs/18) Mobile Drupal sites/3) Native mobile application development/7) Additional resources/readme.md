Several different ways of integrating Views into mobile applications exist. Depending on what you are trying to accomplish, you may want to consider one of these modules:

* Web services  
   * [Services module](http://drupal.org/project/services)  
   * [Content API module](http://drupal.org/project/contentapi) \- provides additional ways of accessing content through Services  
   * [JSON:API](https://www.drupal.org/project/jsonapi) (only for D7, since the module is part of Drupal core in D8/D9). See [JSON:API vs. core's REST module article](https://www.drupal.org/docs/core-modules-and-themes/core-modules/jsonapi-module/jsonapi-vs-cores-rest-module) for comparing both approachs to expose your data from Drupal.
* Using Drupal Views  
   * [Services Views](http://drupal.org/project/services%5Fviews) \- provides a Views resource for the Services module  
   * [Views Datasource](http://drupal.org/project/views%5Fdatasource) \- provides representations in JSON, XML, RDF, xHTML microformats, Atom, and several other formats  
   * [Views Atom](http://drupal.org/project/views%5Fatom) \- Creates an Atom-formatted View for the "Feed" display type

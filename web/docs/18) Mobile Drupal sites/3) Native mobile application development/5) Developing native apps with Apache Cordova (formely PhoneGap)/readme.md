[Apache Cordova (formely PhoneGap)](https://cordova.apache.org/) is a native application wrapper for mobile web content that also provides access to device-level services. PhoneGap supports the iOS, Android, Windows Phone, and BlackBerry mobile application operating systems, and can run on both smartphones and tablet devices.

Several projects for integrating Drupal with PhoneGap exist:

* [Drupal Plugin for PhoneGap for iOS](https://github.com/jefflinwood/Drupal-Plugin-for-PhoneGap-for-iOS), which makes the Drupal iOS SDK accessible through PhoneGap.
* [DrupalGap](http://drupal.org/project/drupalgap) \- An open source mobile application development kit for Drupal websites, with PhoneGap and [jQueryMobile](https://jquerymobile.com/).
